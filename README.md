# CLUE Curriculum

This is a repository for CLUE curriculum unit and teacher guide data. The unit and teacher guide data is imported by [CLUE](https://github.com/concord-consortium/collaborative-learning).

## Adding a Unit

To add a new unit, first decide on a code for the unit. For example, the existing unit Stretching and Shrinking uses the code `sas`. Next, create a subfolder using that code as a name. In that new subdirectory, add a file named `[unit-code]-unit.json`. The file name for Stretching and Shrinking, for example, is sas-unit.json.

Use the unit-template.json file as a starting place to build the new unit file's content.

## Adding a Teacher Guide

In an existing unit directory, add a new file named `[unit-code]-teacher-guide.json`. The teacher guide file name for Stretching and Shrinking, for example, is sas-teacher-guide.json.
