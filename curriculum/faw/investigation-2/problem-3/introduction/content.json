            "<p>Pictures of boxes often look like the box shown at the right. But there is more to a box than what you see in a picture. Think about what we would see if we turned the box, or another rectangular prism, around to show all of its sides. </p><p><em>How many vertices, faces, and edges does the box have?  </em></p><p><em>Would these answers be different for larger or smaller prisms? </em></p><p>Many cities in cold climates celebrate winter with a carnival. Ice sculptures are often among the highlights of winter celebrations. Sculptors start with blocks of ice in the shape of rectangular prisms. Then, they use tools to create spectacular frozen works of art. </p><p>To figure out strategies for carving polygonal prisms out of rectangular prisms, we can experiment with a block of clay and a wire clay cutter. However, once a cut is made it is hard to put the pieces back together. So, it helps to think before carving.</p>"
