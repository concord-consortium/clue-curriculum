            "<p>The volume of right prism is the same as the number of unit cubes in it. You can easily count the number of unit cubes in some rectangular prisms. However, if the dimensions of rectangular prisms are rational numbers rather than integers, or if the base of prism is any other polygons, it may be difficult to count the number of unit cubes. Because the number of unit cubes is related to the number of unit squares in the base, which is the area of the base, you can find the volume of any polygon prism by multiplying the area of base by the height of the prism. You can also write an equation: Volume=Area of Base • height or V = Bh.</p>"
