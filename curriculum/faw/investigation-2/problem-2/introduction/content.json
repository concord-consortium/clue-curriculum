            "<p>Gabriel recalled from the<em> Covering and Surrounding</em> unit that to calculate the exact volume of a rectangular prism, we can visualize packing it with layers of identical unit cubes. This works well for square prisms. Gabriel claims it works for all right prisms.</p><p>Sometimes it is impossible to pack a prism with unit cubes, but a visual image may help. The figures show how you could visualize packing this prism with unit cubes and parts of unit cubes.</p>"
