The boxes you studied in Investigation 1 were all right prisms. In each case the congruent base and top were rectangles, so they could also be called right rectangular prisms. There are many other interesting and useful types of right prisms. If the bases are regular polygons, then the prism is called a regular prism. The regular prisms below all have the same height. </p>"
