            "<p>If you change the dimensions of a rectangular prism by a scale factor f, the surface area will change by the scale factor squared <em>f</em><sup><em>2</em></sup>, and the volume will change by the scale factor cubed <em>f</em><sup><em>3</em></sup><em>.</em></p><p>Creating similar rectangular prisms is enlarging or shrinking each dimension by the same scale factor. It is similar way of creating similar rectangles, which is enlarging or shrinking each dimension by the same scale factor. You use proportional reasoning for both situations. The difference is that you have three dimensions (width, length, height) in rectangular prism, whereas there are two dimensions (length, width) in rectangles. In particular, when creating a box to hold a specific  volume, while using the least material, is like looking for the least perimeter for a specified area.</p>"
