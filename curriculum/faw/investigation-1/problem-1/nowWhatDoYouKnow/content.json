            "<p>The surface area of a rectangular prism is the total area of all faces of it. There are two identical rectangular bases, two identical rectangular lateral faces, and the other two identical rectangular lateral faces. You can find the surface area of a rectangular prism by adding the areas of all six rectangles. Or, you can think of a net of a rectangular prism. The lateral surface is a large rectangle in a net, whose length is equal to the perimeter of its base rectangle.</p><p>The volume of a rectangular prism is the total number of unit cubes in it. You can count the number of unit cubes in the first layer of the prism, which is the area of the base, and then multiply it by the height of the prism. You can also write an equation: Volume=area of base x height = l x w x h.</p>"

            "<p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p><p>In March 2021, the Suez Canal was blocked by the 400-meter-long container ship, the Ever Given.  It blocked all traffic until it was freed six days later. Meanwhile, at least 369 ships were queuing up to pass through the canal which blocked an estimated $9,6 billion worth of trade. Freeing the ship was based on rising tides. Tides are higher whenever there is a full or new moon, which causes a greater gravitational pull on the Earth. These tides are call as spring tides and occur twice a month. In March 2021 the effect was amplified by the first supermoon of the year.</p>"
