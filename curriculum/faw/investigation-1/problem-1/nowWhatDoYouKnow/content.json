            "<p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p><p>In March 2021, the Suez Canal was blocked by the 400-meter-long container ship, the Ever Given.  It blocked all traffic until it was freed six days later. Meanwhile, at least 369 ships were queuing up to pass through the canal which blocked an estimated $9,6 billion worth of trade. Freeing the ship was based on rising tides. Tides are higher whenever there is a full or new moon, which causes a greater gravitational pull on the Earth. These tides are call as spring tides and occur twice a month. In March 2021 the effect was amplified by the first supermoon of the year.</p>"
