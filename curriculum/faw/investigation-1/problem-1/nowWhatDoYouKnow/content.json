            "<p>The surface area of a rectangular prism is the total area of all faces of it. There are two identical rectangular bases, two identical rectangular lateral faces, and the other two identical rectangular lateral faces. You can find the surface area of a rectangular prism by adding the areas of all six rectangles. Or, you can think of a net of a rectangular prism. The lateral surface is a large rectangle in a net, whose length is equal to the perimeter of its base rectangle.</p><p></p><p>The volume of a rectangular prism is the total number of unit cubes in it. You can count the number of unit cubes in the first layer of the prism, which is the area of the base, and then multiply it by the height of the prism. You can also write an equation: Volume=area of base x height = l x w x h.</p>"
