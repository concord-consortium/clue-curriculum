            "<p>The way a product is packaged is important. Stores are filled with containers such as boxes, cans, bags, and bottles that come in interesting three-dimensional shapes. A unique shape can attract shoppers to take a closer look at the product. Some colleges offer degrees in packaging. The college courses include investigating packaging materials and designs to determine which are suitable for products. They also consider various environmental and safety requirements that are imposed by states or countries. </p><p>When a company plans the packaging for a product, it must consider several questions. The company must determine the following: </p><ul><li>how much of the product should be placed in each package</li><li>what and how much material is needed to make the package</li><li>what package design is best for the product</li></ul><p>Thinking about how products are packaged can make us smarter consumers. We can usually save money by comparing the cost of products in different-sized packages. Three-dimensional figures also have many uses, such as designing modes of transportation or exploring gene configurations in biology.</p>"
