When a rectangular prism is a cube that has the same length for length, width, and height, its surface area is smaller than other possible dimensions. For example, as you can see in Situation A of What If...?, with the volume 8, 2 x 2 x 2 has the least surface area; with the volume 27, 3 x 3 x 3 has the least surface area. When the volume of a rectangular prism is not a. cubed number, then the closer to a cube the smaller the surface area it will have.</p>"
