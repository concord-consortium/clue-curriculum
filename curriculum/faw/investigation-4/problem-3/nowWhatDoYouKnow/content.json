It means that they all have the same radius of circle (<em>r</em>) and the same height 2×<em>r</em>, because the height of sphere is the diameter. If you compare their volumes, the volume of the cylinder is equal to the sum of the cone’s volume and the sphere’s volume. The cone’s volume is 1/3 of the cylinder’s and the sphere’s volume is 2/3 of the cylinder’s. You can also say that the volume of the sphere is twice the volume of the cone. A rectangular prism has greater volume than the others. </p>"
