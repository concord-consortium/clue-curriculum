Balls in the shape of <em>spheres</em> play an important role in many of our most popular sports. Cones are used to serve ice cream and direct traffic around construction zones. </p><p>The size and shape of any <em>sphere</em> depends on the size of the radius, which is the distance from any point on the surface to its center. We can describe any sphere using this single dimension. </p><p>The size and shape of a <em>cone</em> depends on the size of two dimensions, the height and the radius of its circular base. </p>"

Fortunately, there is a helpful relationship among the volumes of cylinders, spheres, and cones. A simple experiment will reveal that relationship and the formulas for the volumes of spheres and cones. In this Problem, we will make a sphere, a cone, and a cylinder, each with the same diameter and the same height. </p>"
