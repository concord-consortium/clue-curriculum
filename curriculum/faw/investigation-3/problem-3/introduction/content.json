            "<p><strong>Connecting Circumference and Area</strong></p><p>The special number pi, π ≈ 3.14159 . . ., plays a central role in calculating both circumference and area of circles. The rules for finding circumference <em>C</em> and area of any circle related to its diameter d or radius r are expressed in algebraic symbols by the formulas:</p><p><em>C</em> = π<em>d</em>, or <em>C</em> = 2π<em>r</em>, and <em>A</em> = π<em>r</em><sup>2</sup></p><p>Circumference and area tell quite different things about a circle. However, there is a clever way to show how circumference and area fit together.</p>"
