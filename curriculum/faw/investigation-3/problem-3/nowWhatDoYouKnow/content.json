            "<p>Both of the circumference and the area of a circle are related to the radius and the diameter of the circle. If you know the radius or the diameter of a circle, you can find the circumference and the area of the circle. If the diameter of a circle is a, the circumference is a x π and the area is a x a x π / 4. If the radius of a circle is r, the circumference is 2r x π and the area is r x r x π. Also, you can find the area of a circle when you know its circumference and vice versa. For example, if the circumference of a circle is 10 inches, you can find the diameter of the circle, which is 10/π. Then you can find the area using the diameter.</p>"
