The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter is approximately 3. You can also write an equation, c ≈ 3 • d, where c represents circumference and d represents diameter. If you want to use radius instead of diameter, you can write c ≈ 6 • r, where c means circumference and r means radius. </p>"
