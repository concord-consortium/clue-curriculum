            "<p><strong>Did You Know? </strong></p><p>In 1706, William Jones used the Greek letter for π (also written as pi and pronounced “pie”) to represent this number. He used the symbol to stand for the distance around a circle with a diameter of 1 unit. </p><p>As early as 2000 B.C., the Babylonians knew that π was more than 3. Their estimate for pi was 31/8. By the fifth century, Chinese mathematician Tsu Chung-Chi wrote that π was somewhere between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927. From 1436 to 1874, the known value of π went from 14 places past the decimal point to 707 places. </p><p>We have used computers to calculate millions more digits. Mathematicians have shown that π cannot be expressed as a fraction with whole numbers in the numerator and denominator. Numbers having decimal representations that never come out “even” and have no repeating pattern are called <em>irrational numbers</em>.</p>"
