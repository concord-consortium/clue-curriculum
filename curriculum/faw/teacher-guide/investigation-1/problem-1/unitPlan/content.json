            "<p><strong>Unit Description </strong></p><p>The overarching goals of the Unit are to develop students’ (1) understanding of surface area and volume for common three-dimensional shapes, and of circumference and area of circles; (2) strategies for calculating those measures for prisms, circles, cylinders, spheres, and cones; and (3) skill in application of area and volume concepts to solving measurement problems. </p><p>There are three main structural parts of this Unit. Investigations 1 and 2 build on student knowledge about surface area and volume of rectangular prisms and extend these understandings and skills to other three-dimensional shapes, including right prisms. Investigation 3 develops and applies formulas for circumference and area of circles. To strengthen understanding of area and circumference of circles, students use this knowledge to investigate cylinders. While the primary shapes of this Unit are prisms and circles, Investigation 4 deepens students’ understanding of prisms and circles to develop and apply formulas for surface area and volume of cylinders, spheres, and cones. Applying their knowledge of volume of prisms to develop strategies for volume of shapes that are not prisms strengthens students’ understanding of prisms. These shapes will be revisited with more complexity in the 8th grade <em>Say It With Symbols</em> Unit. </p><p>As with all of the CMP4 Units, one Mathematical Reflection guides the development of the understanding of the mathematical ideas in the Unit. </p><p><em>Mathematical Reflection</em></p><p><em>In this Unit we are exploring measurements of two- and three-dimensional shapes and how these measurements are used to solve real-world problems. At the end of this Investigation, </em></p><p><em>What do you know about measurements of two- and three-dimensional shapes? </em></p>"

Problem 1.3 extends students understanding of area and volume of rectangular prisms by scaling up the dimensions to create similar boxes (scale figures), which strengthens their proportional reasoning and their understanding of area and volume of right prisms.

            "<p><strong>Investigation 2: Connecting Rectangular Prisms to Polygonal Prisms</strong></p><p>This Investigation has three Problems. Problem 2.1 engages students in a hands-on experiment to discover interesting relationships between the surface area and volume of different prisms—if the height of the prism and the perimeter of its base are constant, the figure whose base has the most sides will have the greatest surface area and greatest volume. For many students, this is a counter-intuitive result. However, it is similar to what students discovered when they compared areas of rectangles with fixed perimeter but different dimensions. It is surprising to students that the same piece of stiff paper can be folded in different ways to give solids with different volumes. Problem 2.2 guides students to generalize the layering strategy they used for finding volume of rectangular prisms to a strategy for finding volumes of other right prisms. The general principle is that all such volumes can be calculated as the product of the height and the area of the base. In Problem 2.3, students visualize the shapes (both 2 and 3-dimensional) that are formed when rectangular prisms are sliced by planar “knives.” </p>"

            "<p><strong>Investigation 3: Area and Circumference of Circles </strong></p><p>This Investigation has four Problems, all focused on developing student understanding of the relationships among the radius (and diameter), circumference, and area of a circle. Problem 3.1 asks students to explore the ratio of radius and diameter to circumference for a collection of circular objects, leading to a conjectured formula for those calculations C = πd.  Problem 3.2 engages students in an experiment to find which paper towel is the most absorbent. Drops of water on the towel form circular shapes. Students measure this circular area by laying a transparent grid on the wet spot and counting grid squares that fall within the circles. Student strategies such as the number of radius squares are needed to cover a circle lead to the formula A = πr<sup>2</sup>. Problem 3.3 uses a well- known dissection argument to connect circumferences and areas of circles by showing how you can reassemble sectors of a circle into a shape that is almost a parallelogram. </p><p>The motivation for considering circles in a Unit on solid figures is the essential role of circles in defining and measuring cylinders. In Problem 3.4 students develop formulas for surface areas and volumes of cylinders. Because cylinders are closely related to prisms, this reinforces what students have learned about prisms by looking at non prisms. As the number of sides of a right prism increases the shape of the prism approaches that of a cylinder which also has a greater surface area than any right prism with the same height and perimeter of the base. They also see that the volume of a cylinder can be calculated using a familiar principle—multiplying the area of the base by the height. The volume of a cylinder is greater than the volume of a right prism with the same height and perimeter of the base. This reinforces their understanding of the volumes of prisms and again relies on knowledge about the area of a circle. </p><p>Students connect their knowledge of nets for prisms to analyze nets for cylinders. They derive a formula for surface area of a cylinder by using what they know about the circumference and area of a circle.  Looking at examples and non-examples of a concept is a well-established learning principle. Each problem in this Investigations has several applications of circumference and/or area of circles.</p>"

            "<p><strong>Investigation 4: Designing Packages: More Three-Dimensional Shapes</strong></p><p>In Problem 4.1 students explore a packaging problem the involves designing cylindrical and rectangular containers that have the same volume. Comparing the surface areas of a prism and cylinder with the same volume pushes students to think about how surface area might vary and whether there is an optimal design for a given volume. The next two Problems in this Investigation build naturally on students’ understanding of surface area and volume of a prism and cylinders to extend these understandings to surface area and volume to two other well-known three-dimensional shapes, cones and spheres. In Problem 4.2 students conduct an experiment to explore the relationship among cylinders, cones and spheres that have the same height and dimeter. This leads to generalization for finding formulas for the volume of cones and spheres by referring to a cylinder with the same dimensions. In Problem 4.3 students look at ice cream containers in the shapes of cylinders, cones, and rectangular prisms that have the same dimensions. They then explore the effects of a scoop of ice cream in the shape of a sphere that is allowed to melt on the volume of the container. That is, how much of volume is occupied by the melted ice cream?</p>"
