(Answers will vary.  The circumference of the circle is about twice the length of the base of the “parallelogram” and the height of the “parallelogram” is the length of the radius of the circle.)</p><p>If groups put What If Situation B on large paper have students do a Gallery Walk.  Using sticky notes have students first go to posters that did the same situation their group did and put sticky note questions on posters.  Then have students go to another poster of a situation they didn’t work on.  Using a sticky note decide if they agree or disagree with the group and why or why not.  </p><p>During the Gallery Walk, as a teacher look for the sticky notes that will generate discussions around area and/or circumference of a circle.  Look for the situations that students are unsure of or in disagreement so that the discussion can work on misconceptions or errors. (Language)</p>"
