            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>This Problem has students conducting an experiment testing the absorbency of paper towels.  Using an eyedropper, students drop colored water on paper towels.  It creates a circular shape.  Students will find the area of these circular shapes. This provides students an opportunity to further develop their understanding of how to find area of a circle and pi in a STEM experiment. </p><p><u> Implementation Note</u>:  This problem will take 2 days of class time.  On Day 1 have students complete the Initial Challenge and hold a brief summary.  On Day 2 have students complete the What If and hold a more detailed summary. The strategies in What If Situation A can be divided up in the class and each group is responsible for one strategy to discuss in the Summary.</p>"

Allow for a short discussion on the students’ initial thoughts. We don’t know which one absorbed more water by these sample pictures.
