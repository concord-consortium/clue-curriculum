If the diameters of the other shapes are 6 cm or 8 cm, they can also benefit from one of the nets in <strong>Learning Aid 4.2A: Nets of Cones </strong>to more quickly fit a cone to the cylinder. </p><p>As groups work on the Problem, make sure that the cylinders they make are very close in diameter to their spheres. </p><p>If students follow the directions for the experiment carefully, they will find that the flattened sphere occupies about two thirds of the cylinder, indicating that the sphere’s volume is 2/3 of the cylinder’s volume. In this case, there are several ways to formulate the symbolic rule for this relationship. The cone filled with rice or sand fills 1/3 of the cylinder, indicating that the cone’s volume is 1/3 of the cylinder’s volume.  </p><p>On Day 2 (or when students are ready) distribute <strong>Learning Aid 4.2B: Comparing Volumes of Cylinders, Spheres and Cones</strong> to be used for What If Situation A.</p>"
