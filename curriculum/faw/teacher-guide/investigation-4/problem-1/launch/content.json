(Answers will vary)</li><li>What information do you need to design the rectangular box? (length, width, and height) </li><li>Can you use the same dimensions as the cylinder? Why or why not? (No; you have the height and radius of the cylinder, and a box does not have a radius.) </li></ul><p>Have students work is groups of 2-4 students.  Pose the challenge to the class of designing a rectangular box (prism) that has the same volume as the cylindrical can that is described. Their task is to find length, width, and height.
