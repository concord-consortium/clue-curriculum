Student informally assess how much two numerical data distributions with similar variability overlap.  </p><p>Students examine the mean and the MAD of each distribution to identify whether or not the mean of one distribution is within one or two MADs of the other distribution. Students use this information to decide if the differences between samples are greater than expected from naturally occurring variability.</p>"

(Find the MAD of the distribution. Identify the values that are within one and two MADs from the mean. Any values that are outside of two MADs from the mean can be considered unexpected values.) </p><p>•In this Problem, you will be comparing two distributions of data that have similar variabilities. How can you tell whether two distributions of data have similar variabilities? (Find the MAD or IQR for each distribution. If the distributions have similar MADs or IQRs, they have similar variabilities.) </p><p></p>"
