            "<p>In this Problem, two different numbers of pizzas are placed at tables that seat two different numbers of people. Students must determine whether this situation is fair. They do this by finding how much pizza each person gets at the different tables, or how many people share a pizza. The numbers are small, so the comparison can be the central focus. The Problem is also designed to surface and challenge any incorrect ideas that students have about difference as a comparison strategy.</p>",

You can use the strategies in the What If to connect to how your students engaged in proportional reasoning in the sharing pizzas situation.</p>",

For Situation A, you might have students think about and discuss as a class the strategies not already presented by your students. This may allow a discussion of strategies different from students’ own thinking for solving the Initial Challenge. Situations B and C offer more opportunities to use proportional reasoning.</p>"
