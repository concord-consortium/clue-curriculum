            "<p><strong>Explore (Digging In)</strong></p><p><em>Providing for Individual Needs</em></p><p>It is important for students to think about what might be considered a fast speed for a roller coaster before analyzing the data. We suggest that students do this with their partners in order not to create a whole-class definition of fast initially. Students donâ€™t necessarily have a good notion of speed. This  provides an opportunity for them to wrestle with the idea. Help students think about whether they use speed as a criterion when choosing to ride a roller coaster. These conversations will help the students become more familiar with the data set being explored. </p><p>Having students stand up and work on a vertical surface during this problem can increase engagement and collaboration between students as they work through understanding using IQR and medians to compare the roller coaster speeds.</p><p><strong>Suggested Questions:</strong></p><ul><li>Look at the shapes of the distributions.  What do you notice?  (Answers will vary.)</li><li>What statistics might you use to compare the two distributions?  (measures of center (mean, median) and measures of spread (range, IQR, and MAD))</li><li>The measures of center differ about 2 to 3 miles per hour.  Do you think you would notice that difference if you were riding a roller coaster?  (The differences are not large enough to be important; it would be hard to tell the difference riding on the roller coaster.)</li></ul>"
