Students read about archeologists who knew the approximate time periods during which the sites were settled. The time periods for two newly discovered sites were unknown. </p><p>In this problem, students are asked to use statistics to draw conclusions about when each of the unknown sites was settled. They compare the measurements of the arrowheads from the known sites, thus making comparative inferences about samples of populations. Then they compare data from the known sites to data from the two unknown sites in order to estimate the time period during which each unknown site was settled. </p>"
