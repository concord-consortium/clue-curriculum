This will continue the work on statistical problem solving that students began in the grade 6 unit Data About Us. In Problem 1.1 students look at the context of school clubs to find what makes a sample a representative sample of a population. They will also look at different sampling methods and discuss which would give a more accurate sample. Problem 2.2 uses a context from the unit How Likely Is It?, The Gee Whiz Everyone Wins game. The students collect multiple samples of the same size and use them to decide the size of the population. In Problem 3.3 students decide how to collect a random sample from a population and then compare samples of different sizes.  </p>"

Problem 2.1 has samples of data sets of male and female professional basketball players. Students use these samples to make inferences about the populations and compare the two populations. In Problem 2.2 look at data about wood and steel roller coasters to determine which is the faster coaster. They use measures of center and variability to make their decisions.  Problem 2.3 uses data about arrowhead length from 6 different archeological dig sites. Four sites are known time periods and two are unknown.

In this unit these skills are used to gain insights into how samples from the same population vary from each other. Various sampling plans are discussed, and students learn about the pitfalls of not using random samples. The impact of sample size on the variation among samples is investigated. The goal is to have students understand that, because samples will vary, not every sample will produce a valid inference about a population, no matter how well the sampling plan is designed and executed. They learn that large random samples are more likely to be representative of the underlying population, and more likely to produce valid inferences. Not only can students use samples to draw inferences about a population, but they can also compare samples to decide if they are similar enough to have been drawn from the same population, or different enough that they are likely to have come from two different populations. Students draw on experiences from <em>How Likely Is It?</em> to design and use a simulation to create random samples and make predictions. </p><p>The problems are also designed to give students multiple opportunities to use proportional reasoning.</p><p></p><p>LINK TO THE FUTURE: In future courses students will learn how to measure the confidence they can place in their inferences from samples. </p>"
