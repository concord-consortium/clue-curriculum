            "<p>When we say the results from a sample are representative, we mean that the characteristics of the sample we have selected are like those—or represent—the population from which the sample was chosen. For example, surveying only 6th graders and then making a prediction about the response of all students in the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades would not be a representative sample. The sample of 6th graders is not representative of the population. </p><p>Educational research has shown that students will often evaluate a situation for representativeness from a fairness perspective. They will think about whether a particular sample will be fair—<em>fair </em>meaning that all members of the population have a chance to be a part of a sample. If so, it makes sense to use sample data to draw conclusions about all members of the population. </p><ul><li>For Group 1, is it possible that students have some common characteristic that is more usual for bus riders than for students in the whole school? (The bus might carry younger students, students from the same subdivision, or so on.) </li><li>For Group 2, is it possible that this method systematically skips some groups of students? (This is certainly not the same as deliberately choosing a biased sample by skipping a particular group of students, but neither is it a completely random sample, because it probably ensures that two best friends cannot both be chosen if they meet in the lunch line.) </li><li>For Group 3, is it possible that having surveys from only students who want to respond distorts the results? (Most likely; people who volunteer have a particular opinion or interest that motivates them to take the survey. This method is also referred to as self-selected sampling.) </li><li>For Group 4, is it possible that each student in the school has an equally likely chance of being included in the sample? Would this make the sample representative? (This does give each student the same chance of being chosen and is therefore a random sample.)</li></ul>"
