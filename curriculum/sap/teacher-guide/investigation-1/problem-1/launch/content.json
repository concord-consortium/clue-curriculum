            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>In this problem, students consider a variety of sampling methods. They analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each and determine which would produce a sample most representative of the population. </p><p><strong>Implementation Note</strong>: Have students read the introduction of the unit three times to generate some understanding and interest about the unit.  The first time is for the students to become familiar with the context by asking them What is this unit about?.  The second read through is for students to become familiar with the mathematical content by asking them What are the given quantities in this you can see in this overview?.  In the final read through, the students create mathematical questions using the information given.  </p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>:  This reflection for this unit is the same question that students looked at in the grade 6 unit <em>Data About Us</em>.  From that unit, students should come with the following understandings:</p><ul><li>A statistical question will have a source or specific population.</li><li>A statistical question can result in numerical or categorical data.</li><li>A statistical question will have many different answers.</li><li>Frequency tables, line/dot plots, histograms, and box-and-whisker plots are  ways to collect and organize data for the statistical questions.</li><li>To analyze data, you can look for shape, such as clusters and gaps.</li><li>To analyze data, you can look for spread, such as range, and interquartile range (IQR).</li><li>To analyze data, you can look for measures of center, such as mode, median, and mean.</li><li>To analyze data, you can look for variability, such as mean absolute deviation (MAD).</li></ul>"
