Allow students to ask questions about the data sets.  Getting them to look at the wide variety of samples can help them think about the use of samples, the size of samples, and the way samples are generated.)</em></li><li>Did you use any measures of center (mean, median, mode) to analyze at your 10 samples? <em>(Answers will vary.  Find groups that use this in their analysis of the data sets.)</em></li><li>Did you use the shape (cluster, gaps) of the data to analyze at your 10 samples?<em> (Answers will vary. Find groups that use this in their analysis of the data sets.)</em></li><li>Did you use the spread (range, IQR, MAD) of the data to analyze at your 10 samples? <em>(Answers will vary. Find groups that use this in their analysis of the data sets.)</em></li><li>If we were to use your data set, what would it tell us about the population? <em>(Answers will vary.  Select different pieces to emphasize the importance of multiple samples.)</em></li></ul><p>Discuss the strategies in What If . . . ? Situation A. </p><ul><li>Do these comparisons make sense?  Explain why or why not. <em>(Mateo’s group uses scaling which is a way to predict a population; however, not all samples will mirror a population.  Nevaeh&#x27;s group uses a proportion, which is a way to predict a population; however, not all samples will mirror a population.)</em></li></ul><p><strong>Going Further:</strong> Have students use examples from their data set and use Mateo&#x27;s and Nevaeh&#x27;s strategies. This will help students to see that some samples will be representative of the population while others will not.</p><ul><li>What did you notice about the distribution of blue chips in the mystery container in What If . . . ? Situation B?  <em>(Answers will vary ,but answers should include that the median is 3, the minimum is 1, the maximum is 7, and 50% of the data are between 3 and 4.)</em></li><li>Using the data given in What If . . . ? Situation B, how did you decide how many blue chips you would expect in a sample?  <em>(Answers will vary.  Student answers should include using the box plot where 50% of the data are located. When they are using the bar graph they should see there are more data pieces for 4 blue chips with 3 being close.)  </em></li><li>Why is random sampling important? <em>(Answers will vary.  Students should be able to discuss the importance of trying to represent the entire population.)</em></li></ul>"
