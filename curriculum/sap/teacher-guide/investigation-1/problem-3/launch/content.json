They select random samples of 30 from a population of 100, and they analyze the samples to help them draw conclusions about the population. By comparing graphs and summary statistics of different samples, students learn about how random samples vary, how some may be more representative of the population than others, and how sampling is a good technique in general, but can occasionally lead to drawing poor conclusions. </p>"

            "<p><em>Presenting the Challenge</em></p><p>Introduce your students to <strong>Learning Aid 1.3A: Hours of Exercise</strong> which is a copy of the table in the Student Edition. Have students skim through it and make an initial conclusion about what they see in the data. Talk about the idea of selecting a random sample of students to study rather than calculating statistics and making statistical representations for the entire set of data, or population. </p><p>Have students look back at the four sampling plans from Problem 1.1. Group 4’s strategy reflects a way to choose a random sample of students. Have students explain why each of the other strategies is not a random sampling plan. Refer back to the discussion of each of the strategies in Problem 1.1. </p><p>Discuss how they looked at random samples in Problem 1.2.</p><p>Talk with students about the desirability of sampling plans that produce random samples, samples in which each member of a population has the same chance of being selected. Students can choose their own way to collect a random sample.  Have <strong>Learning Aid 1.3B: 100 Chart or Two Spinners </strong>available. Some groups may want to use that to collect their samples. Have available many options for students to use to find their random samples: spinners, dice, random number generators, <a href=\"https://www.random.org/integers/etc\"></a>etc. You may need to offer suggestions to move conversations forward.<em> (Problem-Solving Environment)</em></p><p>Have students work in groups of 3 on the problem. Each student will draw his or her own random sample, so a group of 3 will have three different distributions to compare. These distributions get compared to sample distributions created by other groups. </p>"
