            "<p><em>Making the Mathematics Explicit </em></p><p><strong>Suggested Questions :</strong></p><ul><li>What insight did you conclude about sleep patterns based on your sample? (Answers will vary.  Have a group/individual share their findings.)</li><li>Did anyone’s data disagree with ________‘s findings? (It is likely that there will be differences based on the random sampling.)</li></ul><p>Have several groups/individuals share their findings and have students respond to if their samples agree or disagree with them. </p><ul><li>Now that we’ve heard from several groups and looked at other groups’ findings would you change your original insight on sleep patterns? (Answers will vary.  Some students will want to change based on seeing other samples and more samples. Some students will want to keep their insights because it is what their sample showed.)</li></ul><p>Use What If Situation A to compare the samples and the whole population. </p><p><strong>Note</strong>: This is a great lesson in why mathematicians never claim that a prediction from one sample is infallible. </p><ul><li>What might you be able to say about the population if we had data from only one sample? (You may want to have students describe how confident they are that they can draw this conclusion using just their sample data.) </li><li>Would some samples give better estimates than others? (Some samples may give better estimates than others. Choosing any random sample, however, gives a good chance of gathering information on a representative sample. If all groups in your class choose random samples, a group who chooses a more representative sample than other groups has done so purely by chance.) </li><li>Does a line plot or box plot of your sample help you make a better estimate? (Either works well, but the box plot predicts the median, not the mean. Additionally, the box plot sometimes makes students think of reporting an interval for a prediction, which is not a bad idea.) </li><li>Would any of the samples have given a poor estimate? (Some samples may have given poor estimates. Again, however, this would be by chance if students used random sampling plans.) </li><li>If there is a sample that would have given a very poor estimate, was this because the sample was chosen incorrectly? (Random sampling plans can also provide poor estimates, as all samples vary from sample to sample, even when sampling is done using proper methods.) </li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> Make the point that a random sample resulting in a poor estimate is not anyone’s fault. This rarely happens. </p><ul><li>What patterns do you see in the measures of spread for the three different distributions in What If Situation B? (The distributions are for medians, which is a measure of center.  As the size of the random sample increase, the medians of the random samples are denser around the value of 8 hours.)</li></ul>"
