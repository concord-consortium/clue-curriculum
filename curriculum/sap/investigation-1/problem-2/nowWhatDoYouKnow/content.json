            "<p>Random sampling is giving every member of a population an equally likely chance of being selected. Many, if not most, random samples do &quot;mirror&quot; the distribution of population data. However, there are samples that appear not to be from the population even though they are. This is what <em>random sampling</em> means.</p><p>We can use proportional thinking to scale random samples to make predictions about a whole population. When you use samples to estimate the properties of populations, you never obtain the correct values exactly. Random error is present in all samples. Sample data are not 100% representative of the population because they are not the entire population! Samples can never provide a perfect depiction of the population from which they are drawn.</p><p>Taking more than one sample and then analyzing those samples can help us get data that more closely mirror the population.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: It is important for students to realize that not all samples are “good” samples BUT that this does not mean they should then decide that sampling is not worthwhile!</p>"
