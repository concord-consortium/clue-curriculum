            "<p>In Problem 1.1, we looked at samples representing the population. In the<em> How Likely Is It?  </em>unit, we learned a process of selecting a sample so that each outcome has the same chance of being chosen. A good sampling plan is one that gives each member of the population the same chance of being selected. To do this, we can use concepts from probability, such as equally likely outcomes. A random sampling plan is a sampling plan that gives each member of a population an equally likely chance of being included in the sample. </p>"
