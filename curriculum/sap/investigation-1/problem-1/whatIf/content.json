            "<p>Lucas uses a representative sampling technique to ensure that he records the total population of children and adults. It is often challenging to determine a sample that represents the same characteristics of the population. In this case, the proportion of the number of children to the number of adults in the sample should be about the same as the population. Lucas has one sample that is about twice the size of the sample used by Quinn. </p><p>Quinn uses a random sampling technique where the park is divided into 48 equal-size areas. In the 48 areas, there is an equal chance in the random areas that a child or adult will be selected in the area. So, the random sampling will be representative of the population. </p><p>Note for Teacher Information: There are about 507 gray dots and 187 orange dots. Both representative and random sampling provide good estimates for the total population of children and adults.</p>"
