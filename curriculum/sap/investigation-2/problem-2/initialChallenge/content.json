            "<ol><li> Answers will vary. 60 mi/h and higher seems fast for a roller coaster since that speed is like driving on a highway.</li><li> Students are likely to say steel-frame coasters even though there is more variability in the data distribution. In summary, the measures of center for steel- and wood-frame coasters are somewhat similar. Speeds of steel-frame coasters vary greatly. Measures of spread (specifically the IQR), show that at least 25% of the steel-frame coasters have speeds that are faster than those of wood-frame coasters. Some wood-frame roller coasters are faster than steel-frame roller coasters, but not all. For example, Wood-Frame Coaster 30 has a top speed of 66 mi/h, but 8 Steel-Frame Coasters have speeds of 66 mi/h or above. The median of the steel-frame coasters (54.5mph) is slightly greater than the median of the wood-frame coasters (53), but the middle 50% of speeds of steel-frame coasters are more variable than those of wood-frame coasters. The IQR for steel-frame coasters (28mph) is more than twice the IQR for wood-frame coasters (10 mph). So, there is more variability around the median for the steel-frame coasters. Based on the means, the speeds of steel-frame roller coasters (≈ 55mph) mean of appear to be faster than the speeds of wood-frame coasters (≈52.6) mean. There is more variability from the mean in the steel-frame roller coasters with a MAD of 14.64 compared to the MAD of 7.47 with the wood-frame coasters.</li></ol>"
