            "<ol><li>Answers will vary. 60 mi/h and higher seems fast for a roller coaster since that speed is like driving on a highway.</li><li>Some students might say steel-frame coasters are faster because they include the highest speed even though there is more variability in the data distribution. Some students may say wood-frame roller coasters are faster because its mean is greater than steel-frame. In summary, the measures of center for steel- and wood-frame coasters are somewhat similar. Speeds of steel-frame coasters vary greatly. Measures of spread (specifically the IQR), show that at least 25% of the wood-frame coasters have speeds that are faster than those of steel-frame coasters. Some, but not all, steel-frame roller coasters are faster than wood-frame roller coasters. For example, wood-frame Coaster 30 has a top speed of 65 mi/h, but 3 steel-frame coasters have speeds of 66 mi/h or above. The median of the wood-frame coasters (50 mi/h) is slightly greater than the median of the steel-frame coasters (45.3 mi/h), but the middle 50% of speeds of steel-frame coasters are more variable than those of wood-frame coasters. The IQR for steel-frame coasters (24.8 mi/h) is more than twice the IQR for wood-frame coasters (10.8 mi/h). So there is more variability around the median for the steel-frame coasters. Based on the means, the speeds of wood-frame roller coasters, mean ≈ 48 mi/h, appear to be faster than the speeds of steel-frame coasters, mean ≈ 44.9 mi/h. There is more variability from the mean in the steel-frame roller coasters, with a MAD of 13.7 compared to the MAD of 7.5 with the wood-frame coasters.</li></ol>"
