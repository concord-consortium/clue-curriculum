            "<p><strong>CLUES - Reflecting on your work </strong></p><p><strong>CLUE</strong> is built to help you reuse and extend everything in a tool tile. You have seen how you can pull in tiles from the curriculum, and from your group mates when you are collaborating. You can also do this with your own work. If you flip to the <strong>Class Work</strong> tab you&#x27;ll be able to sort by <strong>Name </strong>and find your own documents, as well as those of others in your class. These will open up in the left resources pane. Change the<em> </em><strong><em>Show for</em></strong><em> </em>choice to <strong>unit </strong>or <strong>All </strong>and you&#x27;ll see all the work you have done so far. This is handy for reusing solution methods you&#x27;ve already developed, or for reflecting on ways you went about things. You&#x27;ll be able to see the past work of your peers as well, as long as they shared their work. Comparing and contrasting methods is a great way to learn.  </p>"

You can look at work by by <strong><em>Group</em></strong> (to see differences in how each group is developing ideas), by<strong><em> Tools  </em></strong>used, and by<strong><em> Learning Strategy.</em></strong> The strategy sort will help you see over time the way you approach your work and how your classmates do it. If your work isn&#x27;t being sorted into a strategy yet, try the <strong><em>Ideas? </em></strong> button. Our <em>AI agent, </em><strong><em>Ada Insight</em></strong><strong>,</strong> will give you some hints on how to take your learning further. We encourage you to consider whether you agree with Ada, and to record your thoughts about your reasoning. This is another form of work reflection and it will help you become a star learner.</p>"
