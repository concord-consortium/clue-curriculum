You can look at work by name (to find your own), by group (to see th differences in how each group is developing ideas), by tools used, and by Design Strategy. The strategy sort will help you see over time the way you approach your work and how your classmates do it. At some points in the class, you may also find that you may be given a CLUE to how your style of work might be expanded.  If your work isn&#x27;t being sorted into a strategy yet, ask your teacher to make sure to put it in a category for you. You might choose to pick which strategies you used together as a class during presentations or summaries of your work.</p><p>If you try sorting by two strategies, you will see a graph that shows how all the documents fall into the sorted categories.</p>"
