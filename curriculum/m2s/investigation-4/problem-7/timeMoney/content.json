            "<p><strong>Time &amp; Money</strong></p><p>Hi students; we have a client who wants us to help them build a useful model. One of the things people care about is time. For example, students care about the free time they have to do other things apart from school work. Such free time could be used to get a job to make money. Likewise, adults care about their time and money. In this task, you will have the opportunity to revise a model that Kenia developed to decide if it is worth moving to a different city to save money on house rent. </p>"
