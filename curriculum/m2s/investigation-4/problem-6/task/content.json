            "<p><strong>Food Waste in New York state (NYS)</strong></p><p>Effective January 1, 2022, the NYS Food Donation and Food Scraps Recycling law requires businesses and institutions (including universities) that generate an annual average of two tons of wasted food per week or more must:</p><p>1. donate excess edible food; and</p><p>2. recycle all remaining food scraps if they are within 25 miles of an organics recycler (composting facility, anaerobic digester, etc.).</p><p>How does NYS determine which universities generate 4,000 lbs of waste (or more) per week on average? They (essentially) use the following formulas:</p><p>Residential Institutions</p><ul><li>Food waste (lbs/yr) = 0.35 lbs/meal * N of students * 405 meals/student/yr</li></ul><p>Non-Residential Institutions (e.g., community colleges)</p><ul><li>Food waste (lbs/yr) = 0.35 lbs/meal * N of students * 108 meals/student/yr</li></ul><p><em>Students that live in university housing on the university’s campus are “residential”. Those that live elsewhere (e.g. commuters) are “non-residential” students.</em></p>"
