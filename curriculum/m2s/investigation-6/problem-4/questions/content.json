            "<p><strong>American Wages</strong></p><p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps track of salaries around the country. The Bureau also has tools and apps on their website to help workers with different financial questions, such as comparing salaries across states or adjusting for inflation. </p><p>An intern at the Bureau wants to <strong>create an app to help hourly workers</strong> determine how much money they earn. The intern is using M2Studio to build this app. Over the next several slides, the intern will present their steps to you. It is your task to determine if the intern needs to make revisions or can use their work as is. </p><p>In the state of Iowa:</p><ul><li>Minimum wage workers are paid $7.25/hour</li><li>For tip workers, the employer only needs to pay $4.35/hour. If a worker does not earn enough tips, the employer must cover the difference to reach $7.25/hour.</li></ul>"
