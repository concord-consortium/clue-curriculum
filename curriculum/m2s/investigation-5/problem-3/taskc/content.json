For example, they learned that in South Korea, students spend about 12 hours each day in school, by attending both a day school and a night academy. They want to compare this to how much time students spend learning (being taught by a teacher or otherwise supervised by a teacher) in your state.</p><p><strong>Their first task for you: </strong>Help determine how much time students <em>typically</em> spend at school in your state.</p>"
