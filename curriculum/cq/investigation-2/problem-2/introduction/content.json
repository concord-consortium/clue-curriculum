            "<p><em>Did you Know?</em></p><p>Cicadas (si KAY dahs) spend most of their lives underground. One type of cicada emerges above ground every year. Another type of cicada emerges periodically. For example, some species of cicadas come above ground every 13 years. Other species, like Brood X (Brood 10), come up every 17 years. Cicadas do not cause damage to fruits and vegetables directly. However, the females damage trees when they make slits in them to lay eggs.</p><p>In 2021, Brood X emerged i the northern part of the United States. In late April and early May 2024, both the 17- year Brood XIII (Brood 13) in Northern Illinois and the 13-year Brood XIX (Brood 19) emerged in Southeastern United States. This is a rare occurrence since the last time they appeared at the same time was in 1803, when Thomas Jefferson was president. </p><p><em>Source: </em>U.S. Environmental Protecting Agency, &quot;Pesticide and Consumers: Cicadas,&quot; June 13, 2023.
