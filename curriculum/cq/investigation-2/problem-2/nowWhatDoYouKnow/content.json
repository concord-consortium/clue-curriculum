            "<p><em>Did you Know?</em></p><p>Brood X appeared in 2021. According to the Wong and Sinnen (2021) in <em>Scientific American</em>,</p><p>Every 17 years the billions of constituents of Brood X tunnel up from their subterranean lairs to spend their final days partying in the sun. This generation got its start back in 2004 when Facebook existed only at Harvard University and the TV series, <em>Friends</em>, aired its last episode. The newly hatched cicada nymphs fell from the trees and burrowed into the dirt. They have been undergrounf every since, feeding on sap from the rootlets of grasses and trees and slowly maturing. All of that preparation has been leading up to this moment when they surface in droves—up to 1.4 million cicadas per acre—to molt into their adult forms, sing their deafening love song and produce the next generation before dying just a few weeks later.</p><p>In many cultures, insect eating is very common. It is called <em>entomophagy</em>. Insects have high protein value. Since insects are a sustainable protein source, in 2013, the United Nations came out with a recommendation to use insects as a protein source. This has prompted a production of high-tech bug powders and snacks. They have also historically ben a food source for some Native American tribes (Pember, 2021). </p><p><em>Sources:</em> Kate Wong and Cherie Sinnen, &quot;Brood X Cicadas Are Emerging at Last.&quot; <em>Scientific American, </em>May 10, 2021, Accessed online.
