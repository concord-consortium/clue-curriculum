The locker&#x27;s state is changed every time one of its factors touches it. </p><p>For example, Locker 15 will get touched by the Students 1, 3, 5, and 15.</p><p>Student 1 will open it, Student 3 will close it, Student 5 will open it, and Student 15 will close it. Locker 15 will not be open in the end because no one will touch it after Student 15.</p><p>Because square numbers have an odd number of factors, the doors will be left open.</p><p>For example, Locker 25 (a square number) will be touched by Student 1, Student 5, and Student 25. Student 1 will open the locker, Student 5 will close the locker, and Student 25 will open it. It will remain open because no other students will touch Locker 25 after Student 25.</p><p>Students may relate this pattern to the rectangles in Problem 1.3. The odd count leaves the locker open because there is no pairing of &quot;open, close&quot; with all of the factors.</p>"
