            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>In this problem, students analyze claims made by students in another class to decide which claims are ratios. Students identify the ratio comparisons as part-to-part (for example, for every 10 students who prefer cheese, 5 prefer pepperoni) or part-to-whole (for example, for every 15 students, 5 prefer pepperoni). Students will look at what is similar in equivalent ratios and what is different. </p><p><strong>Implementation Note: </strong>This problem will take 2 days. Hold a brief summary after the Initial Challenge to compare their statements before having them continue with What If...? situations.</p>"
