            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>This problem introduces students to comparison statements through the context of claims made about a school fundraising activity. It provides an opportunity to assess students&#x27; knowledge and flexibility with additive and multiplicative thinking. In particular, the problem is structured to give insight into whether your students can begin to make multiplicative comparisons (using fractions, ratios, and/or percents) or whether they can only make additive comparisons (using subtraction). You may also have the opportunity to assess students&#x27; understanding of equivalent fractions, which is the backbone for developing understanding of ratio. Developing the ability to make multiplicative comparisons is a major goal of this unit.</p><p>This problem provides a chance to pre-assess students&#x27; sense of multiplicative reasoning. Students are introduced to comparison statements. One statement is additive. For example, the Academy goal is $150 more than Washington&#x27;s goal. The other statements are multiplicative. For example, for every $60 the Academy students plan to raise, the Central students plan to raise $90. </p><p>The <em>ratio</em> is comparison of two quantities that depends on multiplication and division. A <em>difference</em>, by contrast, is a comparison of two quantities that depends on addition and subtraction. The latter does not represent a ratio. Mathematically, students typically come to grade 6 thinking additively, and they tend to compare using differences. This problem involves comparisons of the fundraising goals of different schools. Ratios are informally introduced in &quot;for every&quot; statements, such as &quot;for every $60 Academy raises, Central raises $90.&quot; </p><p><strong>Management Note: </strong>To optimize class time, you may want to cut apart the comparison statements from <strong>Learning Aid 1.1: Fundraiser Cards. </strong>You can provide sets of the statements in envelopes to pairs of students. </p>"

Also, students should analyze the statements for what you know about two of the fundraising goals. </p><p>Have students reach each claim quietly and make an initial judgement before talking with a partner to come to a consensus. many teachers assign all statements to each pair of students. An optional launch would be to assign one or two statements to each group of students to analyze. Let the groups know that they will justify  their thinking during the class discussion in the summary. Have students begin their work on the comparison statements with a partner and then compare their thinking with another partner group. </p>"
