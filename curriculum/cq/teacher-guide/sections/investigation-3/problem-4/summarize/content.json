When we solved the equation 8.20n = 825 + 3.25n we found that n was equal to 166. 666666.  On the graph that looks like about what <em>n</em> would be at the point of intersection.

Remember when we did that problem with the two brothers in the walking race?</p><p><em>Teacher</em>: Henri and Emile?</p><p><em>Joshua</em>: Yeah.  On the graphs we made the point of intersection when they were equal.  When we looked at their equations we said if we write them as equal to each other we could find that they were equal at the same amount of seconds as the graph showed.  </p><p><em>Franklin</em>: That’s right. It was like 30 seconds I think. So, is Liz right?</p><p><em>Liz</em>: It is! But is it always true that if you solve the equation like we did that you will get the <em>x</em> value of the point of intersection on the graph?</p><p><em>Joshua</em>: Yes. Look at the graph. (He points to the graph on the document camera and points out specific parts.) One line is the 8.20n and the other is the 825 + 3.25n. When they meet that is where they are equal.  When Adia wrote 8.20n = 825 = 3.25n he is just writing it with symbols instead of graphing it.  Then when you solve it you are finding the x part of that point on the graph.  </p>"
