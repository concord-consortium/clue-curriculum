Students can shorten the words by using the colon. Remind students tha the way that you the ratio does not change. For 10:5, we say &quot;10 cheese for 5 pepperoni&quot; or &quot;10 for every 5&quot; or &quot;10 per 5.&quot; This notation can shorten the ratio, but losing the label can be confusing for many students. Students will benefit from labeling the numbers, especially when they are so new to ratio reasoning.</p><p>Ratios and fractions are very different even though you can write both in fraction form. The connection between ratios and fractions can be very complex. For this reason, we do not encourage fraction notation for ratios in this unit. It is important that students learn to recognize ratios before they are asked to differentiate the notation with fractions. </p>"
