(Sample questions: How far did Alana walk if a sponsor donates 12 dollars? How much money would Alana raise from each sponsor if she walked 14 kilometers?)</li><li>How can you use the equation for Alana’s plan to check the answer to the question you wrote? (The equation for Alana’s plan is <em>A</em> = 5 + 0.5<em>d</em>. For the first question, if you substitute 12 for A in the equation and solve for<em>d</em>, you will find the number of kilometers. For the second question, if you substitute 14 for<em>d</em> in the equation and solve for <em>A</em>, you will find how much each sponsor pledges.)</li><li>How can you use a graph to find the number of kilometers that Alana walked if each sponsor donated $17? (You can find 17 on the <em>y</em>-axis and move horizontally until you reach a point on the line. Then, you move vertically down until you hit the <em>x</em>-axis. The value on the <em>x</em>-axis is the number of kilometers walked.)</li></ul><p>Ask the class to show how the questions relate to solving the equation<em> A</em> = 5 + 0.5<em>d</em> when the value of one variable is known.

Students should begin to see that there are an infinite number of coordinate pairs that are solutions of <em>A</em> = 5 + 0.5<em>d</em>. When they are solving a linear equation in one &#x27;unknown,&#x27; they are looking for the missing coordinate of an ordered pair that is a solution of the linear equation.</p>"
