Students will use a tape diagram for solving ratio tasks by creating equivalent ratios and ratio reasoning. </p><p>Help students understand what segmented smoothie bars are, and help them understand the unequal sharing context. Make sure they understand that they can cut the segments into smaller pieces as part of their work. </p><p>Make sure students understand that for each questions, and each part of a questions, they start with a new smoothie bar and so will need to draw new diagrams. </p>"
