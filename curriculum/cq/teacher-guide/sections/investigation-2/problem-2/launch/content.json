Students will explore connections between the ratio table and their previous work in <em>Variables and Patterns</em>. They will explore connections between the ratio table, an equation, and the graph each representing the same relationship between two variables. They will begin to organize equivalent ratios into ratio tables, looking for patterns and underlying structure across the equivalent ratios for two quantities of the form <em>y = ax</em>. </p>"
