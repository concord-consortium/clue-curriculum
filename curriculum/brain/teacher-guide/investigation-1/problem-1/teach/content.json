            "<p><strong><em>10 minutes</em></strong></p><p>Solicit what students currently know about bionic arms via the following prompts. Ask students to individually record their answers in their CLUE workspace and then share their answers:</p><p>1) What do you know about bionic arms? (e.g., what do they look like, why people might use them, in what ways are they connected to the person’s body, how do they work)</p><p>2) If you were tasked to design a bionic arm, what do you think the people who use them would like in terms of appearance and function?</p><p><strong><em>5 minutes</em></strong></p><p>Inform students that throughout this unit we will explore how bionic arms work. Bionic arms are designed for people with congenital or acquired limb differences (e.g., people who lost a limb as a result of an accident). With recent developments in science and engineering, these individuals can now directly control a prosthetic arm as if it was their own biological arm.  Consider showing students <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4128433/\">how hand replacements have changed over time</a>. For additional information on bionic arms <a href=\"https://openbionics.com/how-does-a-bionic-arm-work/\">click here</a>. Note: any content or links from this guide you find useful can be dragged into your teacher Workspace and published to the class. They will show under the <strong>Extensions</strong> tab.</p><p><strong><em>10 minutes</em></strong></p><p>Let students know that they will next watch a video clip of a young woman named Tilly who is the first teenager in the U.K. to use bionic arms. Direct students to observe Tilly’s use of the bionic arms and record their observations and questions they have on  sticky notes. </p><p>Present the &quot;Teen with Bionic Arms Applies Flawless Makeup&quot; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2MjTcmLuIQ\">video</a></p><p>Once students have finished writing on their sticky notes, collect them and arrange them to create <a href=\"https://activatelearning.com/whats-a-driving-question-board-and-how-does-it-shift-students-from-learning-science-to-actively-doing-science/#:~:text=Defining%20the%20Driving%20Question%20Board,Activate%20Learning%27s%20NGSS%2Daligned%20curriculum\">a Driving Question Board</a> in a prominent place of the classroom. We recommend using a piece of poster board with the question “How does Tilly control her bionic arm?” in the middle. This can be added to at any time, so keep the sticky notes around should a student have another thought or question.</p><p><strong><em>10 minutes</em></strong></p><p>Review students’ observations and thinking and bring to mind those that will be most useful for subsequent lessons. Potential student observations and thinking may include:</p><p>“There appears to be an adjustable outer case that clamps the bionic arm to Tilly’s upper arm. I saw that someone adjusted the plastic exterior for her during the video clip.”</p><p>“There is something that allows the residual muscles in Tilly’s upper arm to move the bionic arm.&quot;</p><p>“Somehow Tilly’s brain sends the information to the bionic arm.&quot;</p><p><strong><em>10 minutes</em></strong></p><p>Ask students to think of potential challenges bionic arm users may encounter (e.g., grabbing small objects, user outgrowing arms, issues with charging, limited mobility in the wrist, waterproofing, heat exposure, cleaning the interface between the bionic arm and the remaining limb, tactile feedback). </p><p>Once students brainstorm their ideas individually, ask them to share to the class. Then, have them develop a &quot;Need Statement&quot; in the form of “People using a bionic arm need X in order to do Y.” </p><p>Here are some examples of need statements:</p><p>“Tilly needs her bionic arms to have flexible fingers in order to apply make-up,” “Someone who uses a bionic arm needs a long battery life so they can use it all day.”  </p><p>The need statement requires students to think about and understand the underlying problem they are trying to find a solution to. Inform student that right now we are not worried about the “how.” The “how” comes later in the engineering design process.</p><p><strong><em>20 minutes</em></strong></p><p>Direct students to individually, and then collectively (in teams of three to four) create an illustrated and annotated model that shows how Tilly’s bionic arm works. </p><p>If students use chart paper or a whiteboard, ask them to take a picture of their model and upload it to their CLUE workspace. </p><p>Present the <a href=\"https://openbionics.com/bionic-tilly/\">Open Bionics webpage</a> or guide students to it.</p>"
