(*IMPORTANT* Avoid touching the LED lead directly on the battery pole or you can burn it up! You can also add a resistor in the circuit to avoid any damage of this kind) Explanation: The reason why the LED is glowing is because the current from the positive pole of the battery (Black clip) flows through the graphite band and completes the circuit to the LED; result, the LED is glowing. Now the reason why the LED gets brighter when you get the black clip nearest is because the graphite has some resistance (Doesn&#x27;t conduct electricity perfectly). So the closer you get to the LED, the less resistance the graphite&nbsp; provides, so more current goes to the LED and makes it brighter!</p>"
