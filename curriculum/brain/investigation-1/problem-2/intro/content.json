            "<p>In this lesson, you will learn about electrical signals in the human body. This will help you understand how bionic arms work (like the ones used by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2MjTcmLuIQ&amp;t=1s\">Tilly</a>). </p><p><strong>Do Now</strong></p><p>Working with your classmates, explore the behavior of energy sticks. As a group, your goal is to activate the energy stick (without taking them out of the plastic case). </p><p>Answer the questions and provide any observations bellow: </p><p>1)  How did you and your partners activate the energy stick? Try to come up with at least 3 ways to activate the energy stick. </p><p>2)  What do you think caused the energy stick to activate? What does that tell us about our body?</p>"
