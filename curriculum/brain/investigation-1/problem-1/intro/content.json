            "<p><strong>Overview: </strong></p><p>Throughout this unit, we will explore how bionic arms work. Bionic arms are designed for people with limb differences (e.g., people who lost a limb as a result of an accident). With recent developments in science and engineering, these individuals can now directly control a prosthetic arm as if it was their own biological arm. </p><p><strong>Learning Objectives: </strong></p><p>This activity is intended to help you come up with questions about how body systems interact with one another and with technology. Throughout the unit, you will also learn about the engineering design process: what do engineers do and how their work can help people. </p>"
