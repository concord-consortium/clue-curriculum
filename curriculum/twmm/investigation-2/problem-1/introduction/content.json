            "<p>A <strong>zip line</strong> is a cable that starts at a higher point than it ends. Using the natural decline of the cable, a person or cargo can travel down the wire on a pulley system that minimizes friction to help the rider accelerate.  For example, for a 200′ **zip line** that is 7′ high in the middle (when loaded with a rider), **should** sag 5% or 10 feet. This means that the end attachments are 17′ high each. At this point, plan that the longer the zip line, the higher in the air you'll need to be to start.</p>",
