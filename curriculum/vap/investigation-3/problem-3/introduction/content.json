            "<p><strong>Problem 3.3</strong></p><p><strong>Planning Ahead: Connecting Equations with Tables and Graphs</strong></p><p>In this unit, we have learned about representations that help us to understand the relationship between two variables. Each representation can be used to answer questions and solve problems related to the two variables.</p><p>In the first two investigations of this unit, we used tables and graphs to study relationships between variables. In the last two problems, we have learned about writing equations.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>The work we have done with writing expressions and solving equations in this unit is just a short introduction. As we move through the rest of the units in grade 6, we will continue to look at expressions and equations with one operation. We will also observe how expressions and equations can represent important mathematical patterns.</p>"
