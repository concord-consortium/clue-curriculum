            "<p>To write an equation like in the problems, you need to have two variables that are related to each other. The dependent variable can be increasing/ decreasing as the independent variable increases. And also you need to know how much the dependent variable changes as the independent variable increases by 1. For example, in the equation d = 50t, 50 means the distance for 1 hour, and in the equation C = 3.50n, 3.50 means the price for 1 person. An equation might be useful when you consider various possibilities, such as: “How long would it take to go 600 miles?”, “What about 1,000 miles?”, “How far can I go for 10 hours?”, “What about 15 hours?”, “How many snack packs can I get with $300?”, “What about $1,000?”, or “How much would it cost to buy snack packs for 100 people?”</p>"
