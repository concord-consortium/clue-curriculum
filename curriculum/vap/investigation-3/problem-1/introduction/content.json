We used these representations to look for patterns in the relationships. In some cases, we could only estimate or predict a value using tables or graphs. It is also helpful to express those relationships with rules or equations. </p><p>In this investigation, we will use the patterns in tables to help us write equations that represent the relationships. The equations tell how to calculate the value of one of the variables if we are given the value of the other variable.</p>"
