In tables and graphs, time information is shown as increments associated with the other variable, distance. When you are at the starting point at 8:00 a.m., you have 0 (hours) in your table and graph. In the same way, in written notes, you can get the distance information in terms of the names of locations, such as a barbeque place or the north end of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel. In tables and graphs, distance information is shown as numbers representing how far it is from the starting point. Using written notes, you can understand where they were at certain times of the day, whereas in tables or graphs, you can understand the relationship between time and distance, showing how far they rode from the starting point as time went on.
