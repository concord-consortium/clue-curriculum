Students will have a variety of observations about the pattern of travel shown in the table and the graph. </p><p>They will probably notice that the cyclists went faster in some time periods than others. For example, they might point out that the speed from hour 0.5 to 1.0 is the same as that from hour 2.5 to 3.0, which is faster than the speed from hour 1.0 to 1.5 or from hour 2.0 to 2.5. </p><p>They might notice that there is a “dip” in the graph between hour 3.0 and hour 4.0 and wonder what this could mean. One possible explanation would be that the cyclists made a wrong turn and had to back to get on course. Or one of the cyclists might have dropped something and had to turn back to retrieve it.  </p><p>4.  See the table that follows.</p><p>5.   Answer will vary depending on which entry a student picks. For all entries, from left to right, possible answers are as follows.</p><p>6.   They made the most progress for the first half hour because they went  8 miles from hour 0 to hour 0.5. For the time period from hour 0.5 to 1.0 and from 2.5 to 3.0, they went 7 miles, which was also good progress. The least progress was between hour 3.0 and 3.5 because the distance decreased during the period. Students may say the least progress was made between 2.0 and 2.5 and between 4.0 and 4.5 because they only rode 2 miles during those half-hour periods.</p>"
