            "<h3>Problem Overview</h3><p>In this problem, students graph their real-world data to represent the relationships between time and number of jumping jacks from the experiment in Problem 1.1. This problem continues the discussion of patterns that describe the relationship between two variables. Students will use the experiment data from Problem 1.1 to describe the way the number of jumping jacks changes as time increases in 10-second intervals. The connection between the representations of physical movement, the data in the table, and the visuals of the graph helps students interpret the data. <em>(Portrayal)</em></p>"

The winner is the person who gets four in a row first (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The players take turns telling you two numbers that designate the location of the intersection point for their X or their O. This is different from the traditional game where the Xs and Os are placed in the middle of each square. With little instruction, nearly every student will recall how to graph points in a hurry.</p>"
