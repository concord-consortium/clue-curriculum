            "<p>For What If Situation C pick one or two of the representations and ask: </p><ul><li>What are the variables? (The variables for George, Elizabeth, and Billie are time and distance. The variables for Evo are not labeled. The variables for Bob are time <em>t</em> in seconds and walking rate<em> r</em> in meters per second.) </li><li>Describe the patterns of change between the two variables. How did you find the pattern? (For Elizabeth, for every increase of 2 seconds, the distance increases by 3 meters. Each row of the table increases by the same number of seconds. For Billie, for every 1 second, the distance increases by 2.25 meters. The equation is in the form<em> d = rt</em>, so the walking rate is the same as the value of<em> r</em>. For George, distance increases with time, but there does not seem to be a pattern. For Bob, as rate increases, time decreases.) </li><li>Describe what is happening in each situation. (According to the table, George is not walking at a constant rate. Elizabeth is walking at a constant rate and is using an interval of 2 seconds. If Evo’s represents time and distance, she walked at a consistent rate, stopped for some time, then walked again at a consistent rate. Billie is also walking at a constant rate because the equation is similar to those for Alana, Gilberto, and Leanne. Bob is walking 100 meters, but the rate and time are not known. His walking rate may or may not be constant because the variables are time and rate, not time and distance.) </li><li>After 5 seconds, who is ahead? (According to the table, George walks 25 meters in 5 seconds. In that time, Elizabeth walks 7.5 meters, and Billie walks 11.25 meters. (<strong>Note</strong>: Using the equation for Bob, a time of 5 seconds results in a rate of 20 m/s, which is not a realistic walking rate.) </li></ul><p>The table of Elizabeth’s time and distance represents a linear relationship, but students need to note that time is not increasing by an interval of 1 second. Go back to the idea of writing the rate as a unit rate, as discussed earlier in this section. </p><ul><li>For those that are linear, compare the walking rates to those of the original three students. Who is the fastest? Who is the slowest? (Elizabeth walks 3 meters for every 2 seconds, or 1.5 meters per second. This is faster than Alana but slower than Gilberto. Billie walks 2.25 meters per second, which is faster than Alana and Gilberto but slower than Leanne. Since Leanne is still the fastest, her graph is the steepest.)</li></ul><p> You may want to extend the conversation and conclude by discussing the ideas of being linear and proportional.</p><ul><li>Was every relationship in this problem linear? Explain. (No. The data for George, Bob, and Evo were not linear.)</li><li>Were the linear relationships in this problem proportional? (Yes. If we used values from the table or points from the graph, we could write proportions.)</li><li>How can you tell if a graph does not represent a linear relationship? (A graph represents a linear relationship if it is one straight line. Therefore, if the graph is not a straight line, the relationship it models is not linear.) </li><li>How can you tell if a table does not represent a linear relationship? (A table does not represent a linear relationship if for each unit change in the independent variable, there is not a constant change in the dependent variable.) </li><li>How can you tell if an equation represents a linear relationship? (Various answers. At this time, students’ experiences are limited. Students may identify that there is a number multiplied by one variable to get values for the other variable.) </li></ul>"
