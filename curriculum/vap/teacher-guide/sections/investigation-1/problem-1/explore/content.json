            "<p>While this unit is focused on algebraic reasoning, the unit also informally begins proportional reasoning for grade 6. The vocabulary is first introduced to students in Problem 3.3. By looking at the pattern of relationships between two variables, some situations provide opportunities for students to intuitively develop understandings of ratio and unit rate. Students describe many of the patterns as “consistent” or “steady” when proportional reasoning is involved. You may hear phrases like “for every” or “each time.” The formal language and more explicit reasoning will be developed in later grades 6 and 7 units. It is important to encourage this reasoning.</p>"
