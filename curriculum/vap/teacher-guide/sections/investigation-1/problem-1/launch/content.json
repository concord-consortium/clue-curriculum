            "<p><strong>Comment:</strong></p><p>The main activity is a jumping jack experiment. Doing jumping jacks for 2 minutes is hardly the same as riding a bike for 6−8 hours. However, students can do the jumping jack experiment in the classroom, and experience has shown that it does give students a personal sense of the physical demands of a bike tour. This makes it easier for them to interpret bike-tour data that are given in subsequent problems. So as not to embarrass any student who might not be physically up to jumping jacks, use volunteers. Sometimes, all students want to try doing the jumping jacks. It is a nice way to encourage participation at the beginning of the year. For students who are not able to jump, an alternative would be to use a clothespin or clip. (Portrayal) Opening and closing the clip can count in place of one jumping jack.</p>"

On a treadmill, a person might set the walking speed at 4 miles per hour. One interesting thing about treadmills is that the rate of 4 miles per hour may also be reported as 15 minutes per mile. You might discuss why both these rates are reported or why treadmills do not report the rate in miles per minute or meters per hour. </p>"
