(Note that this is informally solving for T when D is given. Students will have informal ways to find the value, using numerical reasoning or proportional reasoning. Later in the Unit, students will work more on solving the equations symbolically.)</li><li>How do you find how far you can walk in a given time?  Use the examples from What If Situation A for students to demonstrate their thinking.  (Note that this is informally solving for D when T is given. Students will have informal ways to find the values, using numerical reasoning or proportional reasoning. Later in the Unit, students will work more on solving the equations symbolically.)</li><li>How does the equation show the relationship between the two variables? (The equation shows that the distance is the product of the walking rate and the time, or d = rt. The walking rate is the coefficient of the independent variable.) </li><li>Explain what information the numbers and variables in your equation represent. (Take this opportunity to see how students interpret the expression 2t. They should say something like “If my walking rate is 2 meters per second, this is the distance that I walked after t seconds.” Emphasize that 2t means 2 times the value of t.) </li><li>Which variable in your equation is the independent variable, and which is the dependent variable? (Time is the independent variable, and distance is the dependent variable.) </li></ul><p>If some students made graphs during the Explore, display them for the class. </p><ul><li>How is the walking rate represented in these graphs? (The walking rate affects the steepness of the line. The person who walks fastest has the greatest walking rate and, therefore, the steepest line.) </li></ul><p>Pick a typical equation from the class and ask students to use this equation to make a table. </p><ul><li>How does the walking rate show up in the table? (In the table, as the time increases by 1 second, the distance increases by a constant amount equal to the walking rate.) </li><li>Could we represent Liz’s claim with a rate table? (Yes.) What would it look like? </li></ul><ul><li>Possible answer:</li></ul>"
