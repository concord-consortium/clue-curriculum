In a table, it is what the numbers represent. In a graph, it is what each axis represents.)</em></li><li> How can we determine if a description, equation, table, and graph represent the same relationship between two variables? <em>(Answers will vary. Students should be able to discuss the pattern between the variables and how they see that in the table values, the shape of the graph, and the numbers/letters in an equation.)</em></li><li>How does finding the price of admission for different numbers of people help you to see how to write a description and an equation for the relationship between the variables? <em>(Answers will vary. Students should be able to talk about generalizing the pattern they find.)</em></li><li>How can you find the variables if you are given an equation, table, and graph? <em>(Answers will vary. Students should look at the labels of the axes in the graph, the labels of the rows in the table, and the variable letters of the equation.)</em></li><li>How do points on the graph relate to the table? <em>(The coordinate pair values can be found on the table or by extending the table.)</em> The equation? <em>(The coordinate pair values fill in the equation in place of the variables.)</em></li></ul><p>Use any or all of the questions in What If . . . ? Situation A for these questions:</p><ul><li>How do we find solutions when we know the value of one variable? <em>(Answers will vary. Students may talk about guessing and checking, fact families, creating an equivalent representation, and so on.)</em></li><li>How can we find solutions to questions using a table? A graph? An equation?<em> (Using a table, you find the variable you know and then read across to the corresponding variable. Using a graph, you find the point of the variable you know and then look to the other axis to find the other coordinate of the point. Using an equation, you find the variable you know and replace it with the number given then solve for the variable you don’t know.)</em></li></ul>"
