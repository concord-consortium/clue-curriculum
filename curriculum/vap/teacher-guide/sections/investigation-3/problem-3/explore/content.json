Help students to think about how the x variable changes what is happening to the y variable.)</em></li><li>What do you know about the relationship of the variables in Graph ____?<em> (Answers will vary depending on the graph. Help students to verbalize how the y values are changing as the x values increase.)</em></li><li>What do you know about the relationship of the variables in Equation ____? <em>(Answers will vary depending on the equation. Help students to verbalize the equation, and have them think about some examples that they wouldâ€™ve done in Step 1 of writing an equation.)</em></li><li>How do the representations help you to see how the variables are related?<em> (Answers will vary.)</em></li><li>If you know the value of one variable, how do you find the related value of the other variable?<em> (Answers will vary. Students could describe using a table, graph, or equation.)</em></li><li>What information does a point on the graph give? How is this related to the table or equation? <em>(A point on the graph gives the x and y values for that point. It is a value on the table for a specific y related to the specific x. In the equation, it is the independent and dependent variables.)</em></li><li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of the written description? The table? The graph? The equation? <em>(Answers will vary.)</em></li></ul>"
