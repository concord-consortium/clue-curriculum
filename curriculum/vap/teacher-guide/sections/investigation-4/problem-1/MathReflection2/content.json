The Mathematical Reflection can provide a self-assessment for students. Each student can have checkpoints of their understanding of the mathematics after each investigation.</p><p>Students can use the Mathematical Reflection to consolidate their mathematical thinking, take notes, and provide evidence of what they know and can do.</p><p>A teacher can gain an understanding of student thinking during a discussion of the reflection question. Then one can assess individual understanding based on each student’s written work.</p><p>For more on the Teacher Moves listed here, refer to the General Pedagogical Strategies and the Attending to Individual Learning Needs Framework in <em>A Guide to Connected Mathematics® 4.</em></p>"
