Students can pull together their reasoning from the Now What Do You Know? questions to summarize their learning over the time.</p><p>Students can record their responses to the Mathematical Reflection to create a record of their current understandings of the big ideas of the unit. The Mathematical Reflection can provide a self-assessment for students. Each student can have checkpoints of their understanding of the mathematics after each investigation.</p><p>Students can use the reflection to consolidate their mathematical thinking, take notes, and provide evidence of what they know and can do.</p><p>A teacher can gain an understanding of student thinking during a discussion of the reflection question. Then one can assess individual understanding based on each student’s written work.</p><p>For more on the Teacher Moves listed here, refer to the General Pedagogical Strategies and the Attending to Individual Learning Needs Framework in <em>A Guide to Connected Mathematics® 4.</em></p>"

Early in the year you may want to start writing Mathematical Reflections as a whole group. Then as the year progresses, move to small groups, pairs, and finally individuals.</p><p><strong>Notes on Student Responses</strong></p><p>As the first Investigation of the Unit, students may need more collaboration to outline and summarize the important ideas. </p><ul><li>Students will be more confident in discussing the constant of proportionality since this conversation began in Comparing and Scaling. </li><li>Students may rely on contexts to discuss particular expressions and equations. Their general understandings may be fragile at this time.</li><li>Students’ understandings of finding solutions to equations in stories, tables, graphs, and words are at the beginning stages. Students will continue to explore solutions to equations throughout this Unit.</li><li>Students’ understandings about inequalities are at a very informal stage. More will be done in later Investigations.</li></ul>"
