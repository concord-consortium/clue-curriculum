Now they must figure out what price to charge for the tour. They want the price low enough to attract customers. They also need the money collected from the sale of tickets (<strong>income</strong>) to be greater than the money they spend (<strong>expenses</strong>). If income is greater than expenses, the business makes a <strong>profit</strong>.</p>"
