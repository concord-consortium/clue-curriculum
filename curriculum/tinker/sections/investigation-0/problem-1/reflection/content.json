By default, the work you do within a lesson with remain within that lesson.  If you copy something into your learning journal, you will be able to view that work in any lesson. Throughout the lessons, there will be periodic reminders to save some of your work into the learning journal. Whenever you see this, make sure to copy that work into the journal, it will be useful in a later lesson!</p><p>To access your learning journal follow these steps.</p><p></p><p></p>"

The strategy sort will help you see over time the way you approach your work and how your classmates do it. At some points in the class, you may also find that you may be given a CLUE to how your style of work might be expanded.  If your work isn&#x27;t being sorted into a strategy yet, ask your teacher to make sure to put it in a category for you.
