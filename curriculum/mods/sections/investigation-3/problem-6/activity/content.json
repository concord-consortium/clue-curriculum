            "<p><strong>Idea Generation with Prompts</strong></p><p>Below are some prompts to help you generate design solution ideas. Take some time to read these prompts with your class to make sure you understand all of the prompts. Each prompt will help you build on the ideas you already generated in the introductory activity. </p><p>Then, you can choose one prompt and generate a design solution idea for your stakeholders using that prompt.  Sketch your idea. Then explain your design solution idea in the text box below each sketch box. In the text box, you will write down what prompt you used and explain how your design solution works.</p><p>You will work silently during this activity. Take time to think of your ideas, sketch, and write. Try your best not to disturb the other students in the class so everyone can have quiet time to think. </p><p>Below are sketch boxes and text boxes for three sketches. (You also can use pencil and paper.) You can add additional sketch and text boxes for any additional ideas you generate. </p>"
