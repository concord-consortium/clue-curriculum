Front-end engineering design includes practices like mapping, scoping, research, and idea generation-- work to ensure that a design solution meets stakeholder need, that an engineering design solution makes people&#x27;s lives better in some way.  Front-end work is important because if a designer doesn&#x27;t understand stakeholder need, they could design a solution that people don&#x27;t need or don&#x27;t use.</p>"
