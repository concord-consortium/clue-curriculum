What didn&#x27;t work? </li><li>What do you think you did well in today&#x27;s lesson? What do you want to improve?</li></ul><p>Additionally, you should note anything important you learned about idea generation, any questions you have, any design ideas or sketches or whatever else you want to write about!  You can write or sketch (or do both).  You do not need to write in complete sentences. </p><p><strong>Today&#x27;s Recap: Idea Generation Part 2</strong></p><p>Today you continued generating new design solution ideas. You used the SCAMPER prompts with your teammates’ ideas to help you think about design solutions in new ways. You also used the design heuristic cards to help you iterate on your design solution ideas. Using multiple ideation tools like SCAMPER and design heuristics can help you explore more possibilities and develop stronger and creative design solutions.</p>"
