You will be researching using sources on the internet to answer these questions so choose questions that you could answer using internet research. Copy your questions in the &quot;Research Questions&quot; text box below and indicate whether they are natural, social, or design questions.  (You can always add questions to your scoping table so if you have other questions you want to research today you can add them to your table now.)</p>"
