Can you tell which question is a natural question, which is a social question, and which is a design question? </p><ol><li>Where does the water we drink at school come from?</li><li>Do students at my school prefer to drink from the water fountain or use their own water bottles?</li><li>What material is best for a water bottle that keeps water cold for a long period of time?</li></ol><p>Question 1 is a <strong>natural</strong> question because it is about the environment. You would need to learn more about rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water to find the source of your drinking water at school. </p><p>Question 2 is a <strong>social </strong>question because it is about people. You would need to know about the habits and preferences of students at your school to answer that question. </p><p>Question 3 is a<strong> design </strong>question because it is a question about how to design a water bottle. You would have to learn about different water bottle materials that designers have used to answer that question. </p><p>Now let&#x27;s look at the list of questions you made. Identify which questions from your list are most important to you.  Then determine if each of these questions is a natural, social, or design question. Then organize the questions by typing them in the correct column in the table. Your final scoping table should have 2-5 questions in each category. Feel free to add any extra questions you think of as you create the scoping table. </p><p>It may be helpful to evaluate and organize one or two questions as a whole class before you complete the table on your own. </p>"
