In this community, water is provided by the municipal water department to the majority of residential households. Homeowners have been asked to reduce their reliance on the local water department in light of the shortages. Design a device for homeowners to help conserve or generate water to use. The device must be operable within a house or immediate environment outside of the house (i.e., its lot, which are on average half an acre) and should not extend beyond this boundary. The device should also be relatively easy to install and operate by members of the household. </p><p></p>"
