Front-end engineering design includes practices like mapping, scoping, research, and idea generation-- work to ensure that a design solution meets stakeholder need, that an engineering design solution makes people&#x27;s lives better in some way.  Front-end work is important because if a designer doesn&#x27;t understand stakeholder need, they could design a solution that people don&#x27;t need or don&#x27;t use.</p><p>In this lesson you will reflect on what you have learned about designing water conservation solutions that meet stakeholder need. Let&#x27;s start with your Learning Journal.  What did you learn about engineering design? Review your Learning Journal and write down at 2-3 things you learned in the chart below. For each thing you learned, provide evidence from your Learning Journal. There is one example in the table to help you get started. </p><p>When you finish the table, share what you learned with a partner. </p>"
