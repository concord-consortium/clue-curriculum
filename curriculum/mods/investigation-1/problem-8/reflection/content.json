You shared one idea with your class and heard your classmates share their ideas. As you look back at your learning journal, record your final reflections about your engineering design work. </p><p>You can note any reactions to the class presentations and any thoughts or questions you have. </p><p>Then answer these two questions:</p><ul><li>Did you enjoy the front-end engineering design activities (stakeholder mapping/profiling, scoping, research, and idea generation)? Which ones were most enjoyable and why? Which activities were less enjoyable and why?</li><li>As a student of front-end engineering design, what skills do you want to improve? What do you want to learn in the future? Is there a need in your home, school or community that you would like to design for? </li></ul>"
