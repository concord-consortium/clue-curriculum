You shared one idea with your class and heard your classmates share their ideas. As you look back at your learning journal, record your final reflections about your engineering design work. </p><p>You can note any reactions to the class presentations, and any thoughts or questions you have at this point. </p><p>You also should answer these two questions in your reflection:</p><ul><li>Did you enjoy the front-end engineering design activities (stakeholder mapping/profiling, scoping, research, and idea generation)? Which ones were most enjoyable and why? Which activities were not enjoyable and why?</li><li>What </li></ul><p>Take a look at your sketches and think about you work in class today. In the text and sketch boxes below, note anything important you learned about idea generation, any questions you have, any design ideas or sketches or whatever else you want to write about!  </p><p>You can write or sketch in the boxes below (or do both).  You do not need to write in complete sentences. If you don&#x27;t know what to write about, you can answer some (or all) of these questions: </p><ul><li>What parts of today&#x27;s lesson helped you generate ideas? What worked for you? What didn&#x27;t work? </li><li>What do you think you did well in today&#x27;s lesson? What do you want to improve?</li></ul>"
