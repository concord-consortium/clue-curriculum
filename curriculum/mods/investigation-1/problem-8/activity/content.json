You will have two minutes to share your idea. In your two-minute presentation you will show a sketch of your design solution. You will also explain:</p><ul><li>how the design solution works and any special features, and</li><li>how the design solution meets stakeholder need </li></ul><p>Take five minutes to practice what you will say to the class with a partner. Then your teacher will welcome your special guest and facilitate the two-minute presentations for each person in your class. </p><p>After everyone has presented, your special guest can share their thoughts on the design solution ideas. Your teacher and other students in the class can also share their feedback. </p>"
