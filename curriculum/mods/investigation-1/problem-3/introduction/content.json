            "<p><strong>Today&#x27;s Activity:  Stakeholder Profile and Community Research</strong></p><p>Before you can design a solution, you have to understand your stakeholders and get a good idea of what they need. If you don&#x27;t understand stakeholder need, you may design a solution that people don&#x27;t need or don&#x27;t use. To begin exploring stakeholder need, engineering design professionals reflect on what they already know, what they want to learn, and what assumptions they might be making that would keep them from truly understanding stakeholder need. </p><p>In this lesson, we&#x27;ll learn more about stakeholder need through two activities. First, we&#x27;ll make a stakeholder profile to document what we already know about stakeholders and any assumptions we hold. Second, we will explore water conservation solutions in your community and consider how they meet stakeholder need. </p>"
