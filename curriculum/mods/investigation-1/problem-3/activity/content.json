Create a title for your sketch (for example, &quot;Stakeholder Profile of [Insert Name]&quot;)</p><p>2. of at least three things that are important to this stakeholder. Reflect on their values, beliefs, interests, motivations, and anything else you may know about them.  Create one image (from google images) and one text box for each of these important things and add them to the sketch box. </p><p>3. Think of at least three ways that this stakeholder uses water or ways they could conserve water. Create one image (from google images) and one text box for each of these ideas and add them the sketch box. </p><p>4. Look over your images and re-read your text boxes.  Why is water conservation important to this stakeholder? What does this stakeholder need? Add a text box to your sketch to answer these questions. (&quot;Water conservation is important to [name] because [reason]. [Name] could use a design solution that [has/is/does....]&quot;) </p><p>Example: Water conservation is important to Principal Jones because she pays for the school&#x27;s water and wants to save money. Principal Jones needs a design solution that is easy to understand for students of all ages so that all the students save a little water and overall Principal Jones can make the school save a lot of water. </p>"

In the text box below, note<strong> at least two assumptions </strong>you made and how you might clarify these assumptions. </p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>I think Ms. Jones runs the dishwasher in her house every day but I&#x27;m not sure because I don&#x27;t live in her house. She might not even have a dishwasher! I could ask her if she has a dishwasher and how many times she uses it in a week.</li><li>I think most 8th graders do not turn off the tap when they brush their teeth but I&#x27;m not sure. I always turn off the tap because I learned to do this in an assembly last year but I know it is hard to remember so I assume most of the students don&#x27;t do it. I could ask 8th graders about this but they might say they turn off the water when most times the don&#x27;t. Maybe if I could ask them anonymously then they might feel comfortable being honest about whether they turn off the water or not. </li></ul>"
