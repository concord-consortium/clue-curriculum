            "<p><strong>Stakeholder Profile</strong></p><p>Choose one stakeholder that you would like to think about in more depth.  You can choose one of the stakeholders you wrote about in the introductory activity or another stakeholder from your map. </p><p>Take a look at the example stakeholder profile (for Principal Jones). Then begin making your own stakeholder profile in the sketch box below following these steps:</p><p>1. Create a title for your sketch (for example, &quot;Stakeholder Profile of [Name]&quot;)</p><p>2. Think of<u> at least three</u> things that are important to this stakeholder. &quot;Important things&quot; might be their values, beliefs, interests, motivations, or anything else important that you know about them.  Search <a href=\"https://images.google.com/\">google images</a> to find an image that represents each of your ideas about your stakeholder. Upload each image to the sketch box. </p><p>3. Make a caption for each image that explains each thing that is important to your stakeholder. You can use this sentence starter or craft your own sentence(s):</p><p>          [Thing] is important to [name] because [reason].</p><p>3. Think of <u>at least three ways</u> that this stakeholder uses water or ways they could conserve water. Upload one image and one text box caption for each of these ideas and add them the sketch box. For the caption, you can use this sentence starter or craft your own sentence(s):</p><p>          [Name] uses water to [activity] probably about [number of times a day/week].</p><p>          [Name] could conserve water by [action]. </p><p>4. Look over your images and re-read your text boxes.  <strong>Why is water conservation important to this stakeholder? </strong> Add a text box to your sketch to answer these questions. You can use this sentence starter or craft your own sentence(s): </p><p>          Water conservation is important to [name] because [reason]. </p>"

In the text box below, note<strong> at least two assumptions </strong>you made and how you might clarify these assumptions. </p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>I think Ms. Jones runs the dishwasher in her house every day but I&#x27;m not sure because I don&#x27;t live in her house. She might not even have a dishwasher! I could ask her if she has a dishwasher and how many times she uses it in a week.</li><li>I think most 8th graders do not turn off the tap when they brush their teeth but I&#x27;m not sure. I always turn off the tap because I learned to do this in an assembly last year but I know it is hard to remember so I assume most of the students don&#x27;t do it. I could ask 8th graders about this but they might say they turn off the water when most times the don&#x27;t. Maybe if I could ask them anonymously then they might feel comfortable being honest about whether they turn off the water or not. </li></ul>"
