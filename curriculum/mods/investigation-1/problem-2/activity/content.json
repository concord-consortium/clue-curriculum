They might not think it is useful or important or they might have other questions about it. </p><p>Drag each stakeholder name to the group you think fits best. If it seems like a stakeholder could fit in more than one group, you can make a duplicate text box for that stakeholder and add it to both groups. </p><p>4.  Make a title for each group (Users, Resource-Providers, Questioners)</p><p>5. (Optional) Color code your groups. </p><p>6. Examine the stakeholder map you just created.
