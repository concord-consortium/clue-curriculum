            "<p><strong>Need Statement Reframe</strong></p><p>In your learning journal, find your stakeholder need statement. Read the statement. Feel free to make any changes to your need statement. Here are some changes you could consider at this time:</p><p>1) Specify what stakeholders you want to design for. You can design for a larger group (&quot;students in the 7th grade&quot;) or you can make it more specific (&quot;people that use the school&#x27;s teaching garden&quot;).  </p><p>2) Add information about tg based on research you did in the previous lessons. </p><p>Today you will be generating ideas that meet stakeholder need so before you start thinking up ideas, make sure your need statement expresses who your stakeholders are and the most important information about their needsh</p>"
