Each student will write down as many design solution ideas as they can in 5 minutes. Each brainstorm has its own textbox (below) that you can drag into your workspace. Each brainstorm also has its own prompt to follow. Today you will complete three 5 Minute Brainstorms.</p><p>During the brainstorm, write down as many ideas as you can. Your idea does not have to be based on something that already exists. Push yourself to brainstorm as many ideas as possible. Every idea counts!  </p><p>-----</p><p>Type your brainstorm ideas in the text boxes below. </p>"
