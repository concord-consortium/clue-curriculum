            "<p><strong>Research </strong></p><p>In today&#x27;s activity you will choose the most important questions from your scoping table to research. As a reminder, your table contains: </p><ul><li><strong>natural</strong> questions, questions about the environment, and explore where your water comes from and how it gets to you</li><li><strong>social </strong>questions, questions about people and communities, and explore how people use water in their daily lives, or</li><li><strong>design </strong>questions, questions about the design process, and explore existing solutions to water conservation </li></ul><p><strong>Choose Research Questions</strong></p><p>Choose two questions from your scoping table that you want to research. You will be researching using sources on the internet to answer these questions so choose questions that you could answer using internet research. Copy your questions in the &quot;Research Questions&quot; column on the Research Notes table below and indicate whether they are natural, social, or design questions.  (You can always add questions to your scoping table so if you have other questions you want to research today you can add them to your table now.)</p><p><strong>Complete the Research Notes Table</strong></p><p>1. Choose one article from the links below.  You can choose which article you want to read based on the title and description provided or you could open and skim the articles first and then choose the best one for you. </p><p>2. Put the title of your first article at the top of the second column in the Research Notes table. </p><p>3. Read your chosen article. Then answer your research questions with the information from the article. Note anything you learned that is relevant to the question. It&#x27;s possible that this article did not answer your research question fully so also make a note of any information you still want to learn in the table.  </p><p>4. Choose one more article, video or map for your research. Pay attention for what information you still want to learn to choose the right article to read.  If it looks like none of the articles will answer your research questions, you can get permission from your teacher to look for your own article using google search. If you find your article using google, make sure to check with your teacher that the article you find is from a reputable source before you begin reading. </p><p>If you want to research further, you can choose a third article, video, or interactive map for your research. Make notes by adding one additional column to the Research Notes table. </p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong>Choose one of these articles to read first: </strong></p><p> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/04/14/473806134/how-do-we-get-our-drinking-water-in-the-u-s#:~:text=Our%20drinking%20water%20comes%20from,houses%20through%20various%20pipe%20systems.&amp;text=A%20typical%20water%20treatment%20process.,-Annette%20Elizabeth%20Allen\"></a><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/watersense/how-we-use-water\">How Do We Use Water?
