            "<p><strong>Need Statement Reframe</strong></p><p>In your learning journal, find your stakeholder need statement. Read the statement. Feel free to make any changes to your need statement. Here are some changes you could consider at this time:</p><p>1) Specify what stakeholders you want to design for. You can design for a larger group (&quot;students in the 7th grade&quot;) or you can make it more specific (&quot;people that use the school&#x27;s garden&quot;).  </p><p>2) Add information about the needs of these stakeholders based on research you did in the previous lessons. You could explain how these stakeholders use water, estimate how much water they use, and/or say why it is important that they conserve water. </p><p>Make sure your need statement expresses who your stakeholders are and what their needs are.  </p>"
