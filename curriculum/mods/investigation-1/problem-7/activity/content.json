In this activity you will silently brainstorm design solution ideas for that need statement using the chart below. </p><p>First, write your name in the first row, then write down three design solution ideas in that row (under the headings &quot;Idea 1,&quot; &quot;Idea 2,&quot; and &quot;Idea 3&quot;).  Keep the classroom quiet so everyone can have space to think. </p><p>Find a partner. Swap tables with your partner. Now you have your partner&#x27;s table. Read the three ideas your partner came up with in the first row. Then, inspired by your partner&#x27;s ideas, write your name in the second row (of your partner&#x27;s table) and write down three more ideas in the second row.  Try to read and write silently to give your classmates space to think. If you cannot understand something written in the table it is okay to talk quietly with your partner. </p><p>Find a new partner. Swap tables. Read their ideas. Write your name in the third row and write down three more ideas. </p><p>Keep swapping partners until you have filled the table. When you finish, your table will have your ideas in the first row and five additional rows with ideas from your partners.</p>"
