            "<p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p><p>Single-cell amoebas are among the simplest organisms. A single-cell amoeba doubles every 4 days.  The life cycle of an amoeba is typically only a few days.  Most amoebas have no fixed shape and are so small they cannot be seen with the naked eye.  Yet there is one species, <em>Gromia sphaerica, </em>that is the size of a grape!  Amoebas and humans have many common features.  Both have DNA and cellular structure. Amoebas play an important role in agriculture, economics, environment, and health, just to name a few contexts.</p>"
