Exponents are a way to express the multiplicative growth patterns in exponential relationships. As we explored exponential functions in previous investigations, we used standard form, scientific notation, and exponential form to express our thinking about numbers. </p><p>The table shows some values for y = 2<sup>x</sup>. The y-values are given in both exponential form and standard form. </p><p>In this Investigation, we will explore some interesting patterns represented among exponents.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"
