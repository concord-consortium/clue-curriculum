            "<p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p><p>In 1859, 24 wild rabbits were brought to Australia from England and released them into the wild for sport hunting. They had no natural predators. Within a few years, those 24 rabbits multiplied into millions. They continue to play havoc with the environment. For example, it takes less than one rabbit per hectare (about 2.5 acres) to prevent the successful regeneration of many native trees and shrubs. Thus, there is little feed for sheep and cattle to eat. In addition to the economic costs, their warrens (burrows) also cause land degradation and erosion. However, they are a food source for some people.</p><p></p>"
