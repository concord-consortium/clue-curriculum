            "<p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p><p>Some investors use a rule of thumb called the “Rule of 72”. They use it to approximate how long it will take the value of an investment to double. To use this rule, simple divide 72 by the annual interest rate.</p><p>For example, an investment at a 4% interest rate will take approximately 72 ÷ 4, or 18, years to double. At a 10% interest rate, the value of an investment will double in approximately 7.2 years. This rule doesn’t give you exact doubling times, only approximations.</p><p></p><p>Do the doubling times you found in Problem 2.1 fit this rule?</p><p></p>"
