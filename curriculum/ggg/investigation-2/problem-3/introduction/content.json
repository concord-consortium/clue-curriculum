So, for example, </p><ul><li>The increase from year 0 to year 1 is 6% of 5000, or $300</li><li>The increase from year 1 to year 2 is 6% of $5300, or $318. </li><p></p></ul><p>The amount increases because the percent is calculated on the new total. This type of change is called compound growth. We say the increase is compounding because we add the increase before calculating the next increase.</p>"
