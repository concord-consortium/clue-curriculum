The factor is called the <strong>decay factor</strong>. A decay factor is always greater than 0 and less than 1. In Problem 3.1, the decay factor is Â½. Exponential decay patterns are also exponential functions. Their growth pattern is decreasing rather than increasing.</p><p>In this problem we will look at another exponential decay problem. </p>"
