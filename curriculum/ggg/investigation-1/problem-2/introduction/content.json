            "<p><strong>Problem 1.2 </strong></p><p><strong>The King’s Reward: Representing Exponential Functions</strong></p><p>In Problem 1.1 when we found the number of ballots after 10, 20, and 40 cuts, we multiplied long strings of 2s. </p><p>Recall from the unit Number Connections unit that instead of writing long product strings of the same factor, we can use exponential form. We can write </p><p>2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 as 2<sup>5</sup>, which is read “2 to the fifth power.”</p><p>In the expression 2<sup>5</sup>, 5 is the exponent and 2 is the base. When we evaluate 2<sup>5</sup>, </p><p>we get 2<sup>5</sup> = 2 • 2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 32. </p><p>Since there are two ways to write 2<sup>5</sup>, we call </p><p>                 32 the <strong>standard form </strong>and </p><p>                2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 the <strong>expanded form</strong>. </p><p>We also found that as the number of cuts increased by 1, the number of ballots doubled or increased by factor of 2. That is, we found the number of cuts needed to create ballots by multiplying the previous value by a fixed number.  These relationships are called <strong>exponential functions. </strong> This fixed number, the base, is called the <strong>growth factor</strong>. For Chen’s ballot problem, the growth factor is 2. </p><p>If y is the number of ballots after n cuts, then the equation for the relationship is represented by the following equation:       y = 2<sup>n</sup></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"
