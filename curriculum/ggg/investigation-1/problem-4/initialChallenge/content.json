            "<p>The Park Ranger also noted that mold was growing in some areas around Ghost Lake. To better understand the mold growth, she left a loaf bread out on the counter. For several days she collected data on the amount of growth of the mold on the loaf of bread. </p><p>She wrote the equation m = 50(3<sup>d</sup>) to model the exponential growth pattern of the mold. In this equation, <em>m</em> is the area of the mold in square millimeters after <em>d</em> days.  She used the equation to find the following information:</p><ul><li>Area of the mold at the start of the data collection</li><li>The growth factor</li><li>The area of the mold after 5 days</li><li>The day the area of the mold reached 6,400 square millimeters</li><p></p></ul><ol><li>Explain how she could use the equation to find each piece of information.</li><li>How is the growth factor and initial population for an exponential function represented in an equation that represents the function? </li></ol>"
