In Problems 1.1 and 1.2 the exponential functions had y-intercepts of 1 and Â½ . For exponential functions, the y-intercept is also called the <strong>initial value </strong>or <em>initial population</em>. The following problem is another example of exponential growth.</p><p></p><p>Mold can spread rapidly. For example, the area covered by mold on a loaf of bread that is left out in warm weather grows exponentially.</p>"
