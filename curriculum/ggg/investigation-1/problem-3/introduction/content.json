            "<p>Did You Know?</p><p></p><p>Lake Victoria, in western Africa, is on the border of Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya. The lake is the largest tropical lake in the world. It is the second largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area. (Lake Superior in North America on the border of Michigan and Minnesota in the US and Canada is the largest by surface area.) Lake Victoria is a habitat for crocodiles, hippopotamus, many birds, and many fish.</p><p></p><p>Lake Victoria has experienced many environmental issues including invasive species. The water hyacinth is an example invasive plant. Since the plant is not native to the lake and has no natural predators, it grows exponentially.</p><p></p><p>The water hyacinth has crowded the lake in some areas impacting the native plants and fish. It has also made it difficult for fishing boats to maneuver. It allows for breeding of mosquitos and other insects that can spread diseases. Also, the plant is decreasing the amount of oxygen in the water. Researchers are looking for the ways to control the spread plants and looking for any positive impacts the plants might have.</p><p></p><p>“A cool/unusual fact: Water hyacinth plants reproduce quickly and can double in just two weeks. This means 10 initial plants can multiply to over 600 within 3 months!”</p><p></p><p>https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/national_invasive_species_awareness_week_water_hyacinth_bohling16</p><p></p><p></p>"
