            "<p>Students look at the context of a young boy challenging his older brother toa race. Students explore the question, “How long should the race be so thatthe younger brother wins in a close race?” This Problem introduces the idea of students finding the point of intersection of two linear relationships using a graph, a table, or numeric reasoning. The Problem also assesses what students have learned about linear relationships and their representations from Investigation 1. </p>",
            "<p><strong>Implementation Note:</strong> You might have a short summary after the Initial Challenge. This will give students a chance to share their strategies and how they made sense of the race question before going on to answer more detailed questions. You may want to use the What If...? questions to push the conversation during the Summarize. Ask the questions and pause for students to think about and record their answers, then engage the class in a discussion of ideas.</p>"

At this time in the Unit, students are likely to mention the context of the problem rather than formal language of the value of b.

Zero y-coordinate: Look for students to choose a proportional relationship. Sample: Gilberto’s pledge plan can be modeled by a line that passes through the origin. Negative y-coordinate: Look for students to choose the relationship(s) that when written in the form y = b + mx has a negative value of b.
