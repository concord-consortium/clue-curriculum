            "<p><strong>Suggested Questions</strong></p><ul><li>In Situation B, did you draw visual equations to help you solve any of them? (Answers will vary. Some students need to think about or see the visual equations when the pouches are on both sides of the equal sign, like in #2 and #3. Other students will need to think about or see the visual equations when there is a grouping symbol [parentheses].)</li><li>Describe a general method for solving equations. (Generally, you want to isolate the variable [pouch] on one side of the equation and a number [coins] on the other side. To do this, you can use properties of equality or “undo” the operations until you have the variable alone on one side of the equality and a number on the other side. You use the number that the variable equals to check your solution. You substitute the number for the value of the variable in the original equation to see if you have a true statement.)</li></ul><p>Students should be able to generalize that adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing by the same number maintains equality. Be sure to stress that they cannot multiply or divide by 0. Dividing by 0 has no meaning and multiplying by 0 would make any statement always true, so it is not a helpful strategy in finding a specific solution. For example, suppose we start with 3b = 27, which we know is true only when b = 9. Multiplying each side by 0 gives 3b * 0 = 9 * 0, or 0 * 0. This statement is true for all values of the variable, not just 9. So multiplying both sides by 0 gives an equality that is not equivalent to the original equation because it has different solutions. If you have not already addressed the common error of subtracting when dividing is needed, do so now.</p><p>Review that, in a given equation, the value of <em>x</em> (or the number of coins in each pouch) is the same. Checking the answer provides an opportunity for students to practice work with parentheses and review the order of operations.</p>"
