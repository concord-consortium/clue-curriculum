            "<p>In this Problem, students explore a symbolic method for finding the point of intersection of two lines. Students connect this method to other methods of finding the point of intersection, such as using a graph or table of data that represents each relationship.</p>",
            "<p>Students find the point of intersection of two lines by setting the expressions for <em>y</em> equal to each other and then solving for <em>x</em>. They use the <em>x</em>-value to find the <em>y</em>-value for the coordinates of the intersection point. If the two relationships are represented by <em>y</em><sub><em>1</em></sub><em> = mx + b</em> and <em>y</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em> = kx + c</em>, then the point of intersection of the lines representing each equation occurs when <em>y</em><sub><em>1</em></sub><sub> </sub>= <em>y</em><sub><em>2</em></sub>, or<em> mx + b = kx + c</em>.</p>",

They also write and interpret equivalent expressions and solve inequalities using graphs and equations.</p>",

(10 T-shirts cost $45. Because the point lies below the line representing <em>C</em><sub><em>m</em></sub> = 49 + n, the cost of 10 T-shirts from No-Shrink is cheaper than the cost of 10 T-shirts from Mighty Tee.) </li></ul>",
            "<p>Choose a point that does not lie on either line, such as (6, 40). </p>",
            "<ul><li>Does this point lie on either line? (No, it falls below the line for <em>C</em><sub><em>m</em></sub> and above the line for <em>C</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>.)</li></ul>",
            "<p>Draw students’ attention to the point of intersection on the graph. </p>",
            "<ul><li>What information do the coordinates of the point of intersection of the two lines give you about this situation? (They tell you the number of T-shirts required for the cost of the two plans to be equal.) </li><li>Show how you could use the two equations to find the coordinates of the point of intersection of the two lines. That is, for what number of T-shirts <em>n</em> is <em>C</em><sub><em>mighty</em></sub> = <em>C</em><sub><em>No-Shrink</em></sub>? (You can solve the equation 4.5<em>n</em> = 49 + <em>n</em>. <em>n</em> = 14. You substitute this value into one of the equations to find the value of <em>C</em>, which is 63.) </li><li>For what number(s) of T-shirts is plan <em>C</em><sub><em>mighty</em></sub> less than plan <em>C</em><sub><em>No-Shrink</em></sub>? That is, when is <em>C</em><sub><em>mighty</em></sub><em> &lt; C</em><sub><em>No-Shrink</em></sub>? (Once you know for what value of n the two plans are equal, you can choose a value either greater or less than this value of <em>n</em>. You can substitute this value into the equality to determine which cost is greater for that value of <em>n</em>.)</li><li>How could you use the equation or its graph or table to find the number of T-shirts where the cost is less than $60? That is, for values of <em>n</em> is <em>C</em><sub><em>mighty</em></sub> &lt; 60?   Or 49 + <em>n</em> &lt; $60? (Students could change the inequality to 49 + <em>n</em> = $60 and solve for <em>n</em>. Then use the value of the n to reason about the solutions to the inequality. Another way to find solutions to the inequality is to look at the graph. Students will see that when <em>n</em> = 18, the graph of <em>C</em><sub><em>mighty</em></sub> is below the graph of <em>C</em><sub><em>No-Shrink</em></sub>. In fact, for all values of <em>n</em> that are greater than 14, the graph of <em>C</em><sub><em>mighty</em></sub> is below the graph of <em>C</em><sub><em>No-Shrink</em></sub>. This means that all numbers greater than 14 are solutions to the inequality <em>C</em><sub><em>mighty</em></sub> &lt; <em>C</em><sub><em>No-Shrink</em></sub>. Be sure students are comfortable using the graph to answer these questions.)</li></ul>",
