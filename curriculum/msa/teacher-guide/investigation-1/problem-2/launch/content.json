            "Students explore the walking rates of three students. They look at the walking rate and its effect on various representations of the relationship between distance and time. This Problem introduces ways to represent proportional linear relationships between two variables using tables, graphs, and equations. It is also the first time that students are asked to explain why a relationship is linear or to recognize a linear relationship from a table or an equation."

What do you notice about the data on the graph? (The data lines up because the pattern is consistent.)</li><li> How does this show up in the table? (Every increase of 1 second adds 1.5 meters to the distance.)</li><li> Because this pattern of change describes how your data consistently increases over time, we call this the rate of change.

Possible answer includes: If you increase the rate at which you walk, you can cover more distance in a given time. The distance in the table would increase for each second walked, and the graph would be steeper. Similarly, if you walk faster, it takes less time to cover a certain distance. The equation would have a larger number that multiplies by the variable.)</li></ul>"
