            "A new situation involving collecting money from sponsors for the walkathon helps student compare and contrast proportional to non-proportional relationships. The Problem furthers students’ understanding of rate of change between the two variables in a linear relationship. Students will compare the amount of money donated and the distance walked for a walkathon. Students see linear relationships in a new context and interpret information using verbal descriptions, tables, graphs, and equations. They also informally explore the y-intercept."

            "<ul><li>What variables can affect the amount of money that a student raises? (The variables are the pledge amount for each sponsor, the distance a student walks, and the number of sponsors.) </li><li>How can you use these variables to estimate the amount of money each student will collect? (If you know how much a sponsor pledges to donate and how far the student plans to walk, you can figure out how much each student might collect from each sponsor. For example, if the sponsor pledges to donate $4 for each kilometer walked, and the student plans to walk 5 kilometers, then you can estimate that the student will collect 4 * 5 = $20 from each sponsor.) </li><li>Will the amount of money raised be the same for each walker? Explain. (No. The amount of money raised might depend on the distance that each student walks, as well as his or her pledge plan, so the amount of money raised may not be the same for each walker.) </li><li>Which variable is the independent variable? Which is the dependent variable? (Distance walked is the independent variable, and the amount of money raised from each sponsor is the dependent variable.) </li></ul>",

            "<ul><li>How might you decide who is going to raise the most money? (Various answers. Do not have students go into detail. Asking the question is just to get a formative assessment of whether students may have solution strategies in mind.)</li></ul>",
            "<p>If students hesitate, offer a solution strategy by asking questions.</p>",
            "<ul><li>How might a table, graph, or equation help you decide who will raise the most money? (Various answers. No exact answer is needed at this time.)</li></ul>"
