Students determine their walking rates in meters per second as a ratio of distance to time. This Problem connects back to the rate work done in Comparing and Scaling while laying the foundation for using rate to look at patterns of change. Students answer questions about time and distance using their constant walking rates and write an equation that models the distance walked over time at their constant walking rates.</p>"

Students should offer some reasoning for saying that they are fast or slow, such as, Teri always passes me in the hall because I walk slowly.) </li><li>What do you think your walking rate is in miles per hour?

On a treadmill, a person might set the walking speed at 4 miles per hour. One interesting thing about treadmills is that the rate of 4 miles per hour may also be reported as 15 minutes per mile. You might discuss why both these rates are reported or why treadmills do not report the rate in miles per minute or meters per hour. </p>"
