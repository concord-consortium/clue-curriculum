            "<h3>Problem Overview</h3><p>This Problem introduces negative rates of change (negative slope). It poses two situations involving a decreasing linear relationship. That is, for every unit change in the independent variable, the dependent variable decreases by a constant positive amount (which is equivalent to saying the dependent variable increases by a constant negative amount).</p><p>One situation uses a graphical representation, and the other uses a tabular representation. Students interpret and compare information from different representations and build on skills recognizing linear relationships from various representations. The y-intercept is named and students begin to interpret it as a point on a line, an entry in a table, or as the constant<em> b</em> in the equation <em>y = ax + b</em>.</p>"
