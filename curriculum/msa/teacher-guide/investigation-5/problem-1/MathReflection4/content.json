As you progress through the Unit, students can use the contexts, representation, and connections to express a more solid understanding. By the end of the Unit, students can create a complete picture of understanding.</p><p>After the class discussion, students can record their responses to the Mathematical Reflection to create a record of their current understandings of the big ideas of the Unit. </p><p>A teacher can gain an understanding of student thinking during a discussion of the reflection question. Then one can assess individual understanding based on each student’s written work.</p>"
