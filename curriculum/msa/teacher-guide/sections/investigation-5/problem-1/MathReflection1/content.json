They may need examples of writing, diagrams, and/or justifications from other students to help build their vision of what is expected when answering the Mathematical Reflection. Early in the year, you may want to start writing Mathematical Reflections as a whole group.

Their general understandings may be fragile at this time.</li><li>Students’ understandings of finding solutions to equations in stories, tables, graphs, and words are at the beginning stages. Students will continue to explore solutions to equations throughout this Unit.</li><li>Students’ understandings about inequalities are at a very informal stage.
