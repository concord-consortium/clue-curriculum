            "<p><strong>Mathematical Reflection</strong></p><p>The Mathematical Reflection provides an opportunity to discuss the goals of the Investigation. Students can pull together their reasoning from the Now What Do You Know? questions to summarize their learning over the time. (TIME) Each Investigation contributes to students’ conceptual understandings of the ideas in the Unit. Students’  explanations at the beginning of a Unit might be just forming. As you progress through the Unit, students can use the contexts, representation, and connections to express a more solid understanding. By the end of the Unit, students can create a complete picture of understanding. After the class discussion, students can record their responses to the Mathematical Reflection to create a record of their current understandings of the big ideas of the Unit. A teacher can gain an understanding of student thinking during a discussion of the reflection question. Then one can assess individual understanding based on each student’s written work. </p>"
