Use one or two of the more typical walking rates to answer the questions in the Problem. If students record their walking rates as both a rate and a ratio, ask how they are the same. You might ask students to write their walking rates in seconds per meter. If so, you can then ask questions to relate back to concepts in Comparing and Scaling.</p>"

Later in the Unit, students will work more on solving the equations symbolically.)</li><li>How does the equation show the relationship between the two variables? (The equation shows that the distance is the product of the walking rate and the time, or d = rt. The walking rate is the coefficient of the independent variable.) </li><li>Explain what information the numbers and variables in your equation represent. (Take this opportunity to see how students interpret the expression 2t. They should say something like “If my walking rate is 2 meters per second, this is the distance that I walked after t seconds.” Emphasize that 2t means 2 times the value of t.) </li><li>Which variable in your equation is the independent variable, and which is the dependent variable? (Time is the independent variable, and distance is the dependent variable.) </li></ul><p>If some students made graphs during the Explore, display them for the class. </p><ul><li>How is the walking rate represented in these graphs?
