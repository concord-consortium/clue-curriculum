Situation A, when students determine whether there is a profit for making and selling 125 cakes, they can just compute the expenses and income and then subtract the expenses from the income. Be sure students see the connection between this numerical strategy and how it is represented on the graph. The profit is the vertical distance between the two points (125, I) and (125, E) on the graphs. Point out that, in this case, the expenses are greater than the income, so the vertical distance actually represents a loss.</p><p>Encourage students to check their answers as they continue to answer questions.</p>"
