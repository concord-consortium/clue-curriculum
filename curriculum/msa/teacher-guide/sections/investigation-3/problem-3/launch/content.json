            "<h3>Problem Overview</h3><p>In this problem, students develop symbolic strategies for solving equations of the form <em>px + q = r</em> and <em>p(x + q) = r</em>, where <em>p</em>, <em>q</em>, and <em>r</em> are specific rational numbers. Students find the solutions to these linear equations using the properties of equality. Students compare this method with other methods they have used for solving equations. Students may mention finding solutions using tables and graphs.</p><p>Students also continue to solve word problems leading to inequalities of the form <em>px + q &gt; r</em> or <em>px + q &lt; r</em>, where <em>p</em>, <em>q</em>, and <em>r</em> are specific rational numbers. </p>"

            "<p><strong>Launch (Getting Started)</strong></p><p><em>Connecting to Prior Knowledge</em></p><p><strong>Suggested Questions</strong></p><ul><li>Display these two equations: 2x + 10 = 16 and 2x - 10 = 16. (Language) How do the equations compare? (They are the same except that 10 is added to the left side of the first equation and 10 is subtracted from the left side of the second equation.)</li><li>How would you begin solving these two equations? (In the first equation, you would subtract 10 from each side, since we want to “undo” the “+10.” In the second equation, you would add 10 to each side, since we want to “undo” the “-10.” Some students may note that you could divide by 2 first.) </li><li>In the first equation, instead of subtracting 10 from each side, could we add -10 to each side? (Yes, because subtracting 10 is the same as adding -10.) </li></ul><p>Refer back to <em>Completely Rational</em> if students need more help with this. </p><ul><li>How can you solve the second equation? (Some students may note that it is like you owe 10 coins. Add 10 coins to each side. Since 2x = 26, x = 13. Students may comment that this is similar to the red chips in<em> Completely Rational.</em>)</li></ul><p>To help students focus on individual parts of the equations, ask the following:</p><ul><li>In the Initial Challenge Set 1, how are the equations alike, and how are they different? (All of the equations have the same numbers. The only differences are the signs of those numbers.</li></ul><p>If you did not introduce <strong>properties of equality</strong> in the summarize of the last problem, introduce the term now.</p>"
