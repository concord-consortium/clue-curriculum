Call on different students to discuss their methods. (Agency, Identity, Ownership) After a group has presented its solutions, ask the class if they have any questions they want to ask the group. For example, encourage them to ask questions like the following:</p><ul><li>Why did you do this at Step 2?</li><li>Why did you not consider starting with a different step?</li><li>Was there a shorter way of getting to the answer? </li></ul><p>In the Initial Challenge Set 1, the same set of numbers is used; only the signs change (addition, subtraction, negative, and positive). This is a good opportunity to observe if students are making sense of the operations.</p><p><strong>Suggested Questions </strong></p><ul><li>What do the equations in Initial Challenge Set 1, parts (a) and (c), have in common? (They can be associated with the same two-variable equation, 5<em>x</em> + 10 = y. The solutions (2, 20) and (-6, -20) could be found on the same line. In the first equation, <em>y</em> = 20, and we are trying to find the corresponding value of <em>x</em>. In the second equation, <em>y</em> = -20, and we are trying to find the corresponding value of <em>x</em>.)</li><li>How else could you find the corresponding values for <em>x</em>?

            "<p>In Initial Challenge Set 3 part (a), students may apply the Distributive Property to the left-hand side of the equation to write the equivalent expression 3<em>x</em> + 3, but this is not necessary. They could also begin by dividing each side by 3. Students will likely choose whichever method they find easier to solve. </p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Students may have some confusion about applying the Distributive Property. It is not necessary to apply the Distributive Property to both sides of an equation. It is used to replace one expression with an equivalent expression that makes the equation easier to solve.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Tables and graphs can also be used to solve linear equations. Some students may bring this up or you may want to bring it up. For example, the equation 2x – 5 = x + 7 can be solved by finding the point of intersection of y<sub>1</sub> = 2x – 5 and y<sub>2</sub> = x + 7 on a graphing calculator. Sometimes it is quicker to use symbolic methods rather than spend time entering equations into a calculator. However, if calculators or online graphers are already being used, and if several questions of this type are being asked, then tables or graphs might be more efficient.</p><p><em>Making the Mathematics Explicit </em></p><p>While discussing the Initial Challenge Set 3, <strong>Teaching Aid 3.3A: Set 3 Student Thinking </strong>could be used if multiple strategies didn’t come out from your students. Students’ strategies for three different linear equations are given as an opportunity for students to analyze typical errors or strategies that can occur in solving a linear equation. </p><p>While discussing What If...?  Situation A, <strong>Teaching Aid 3.3B: Situation A</strong> can be used to show how a table and graph might be used to find the solutions to equations.</p><p>What If...? Situation B allows you to assess how comfortable your students are using the properties of equality to solve equations. With many previous equations, students may have used numerical reasoning, guess and check, tables, or graphs to find the solutions. With the quantities in the forensic formulas, solving the equation symbolically becomes an efficient way to find the solution. </p><p>Write the following equation on the board: </p><p>61.412 + 2.317F = 150</p><ul><li>How is this equation different from most of the equations in this problem? (The coefficient of <em>x</em> is not a whole number.)</li><li>How can we solve this equation? (The principles of equality work for all real numbers, so we can apply the properties of equality:</li></ul><p>              61.412 + 2.317F = 150                              </p><p>                                    2.317F = 88.588 </p><p>                                                  F = 38.2339231</p><ul><li>How does solving this equation help you solve the inequality 61.412 + 2.317F &lt; 150?</li></ul><p>Some students might raise the point that you can’t have negative femur lengths, but the mathematical operations make it seem that way. If so, you will have to have an informal conversation about models working for certain quantities. Later in mathematics, there will be a focus on the domain where students will consider which <em>x</em>-axis values make sense in a situation.</p><ul><li>How did you decide which equations were equivalent in What If ...? Situation C? (Answers will vary.)</li></ul>"
