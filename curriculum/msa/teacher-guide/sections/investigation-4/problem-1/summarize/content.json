            "<p><em>Making the Mathematics Explicit</em></p><p><strong>Suggested Questions</strong></p><ul><li>Are some stairs steeper than others? If so, how can you tell? (Yes. When climbing stairs, you can tell that some sets are steeper than others because some are easier to climb than others. Mathematically, you can tell that some stairs are steeper than others if their rise-to-run ratios are different.) </li><li>What is the steepest set of stairs in our list? The least steep set of stairs? How do you know? (Answers will vary based on student measurements. Students should be able to justify their answers, though, by comparing the ratios of rise to run. The stairs with the greatest ratio are the steepest, and the stairs with the least ratio are the least steep.) </li><li>Can you order the entire list of stairs from least to greatest in terms of steepness? (Yes. You can do this by ordering their ratios from least to greatest.) </li></ul><p>These questions focus attention on uses of the ratio as a way of characterizing steepness in a mathematical sense. Steer the discussion to measures of rise and run. Make the connection to the Unit <em>Comparing and Scaling</em>, in which the students learned to form ratios as a way to compare situations. </p><p>If you have not done so already, talk about the carpenters’ guidelines with your students. </p><ul><li>How do the ratios of the stairs we measured compare to the carpenters’ guidelines? Which ones meet the standards and which ones do not? (Answers will vary, but they should be reasonably close. If not, discuss possible reasons for large deviations.) </li><li>What do you think influences a builder’s decision on the run of a set of steps? (Answers will vary. Students may suggest that handicap requirements, wider run to accommodate items such as planters, and aesthetics may influence a builder’s design.) </li><li>What do you think influences a builder’s decision on the rise of a set of steps? (A builder may consider how high a person of average height can comfortably step when deciding on the rise of a set of stairs. In these questions, students should be making comparisons using the ratio of the rise to the run.) </li><li>Now let’s think about another common object that you have climbed—a ladder. How can you use what you have learned so far to help make sense of steepness as it applies to ladders? What would make a ladder feel steep and what would make the same ladder feel less steep? (The angle of the ladder against the house will affect the rise, so it will affect how easy or difficult the ladder is to climb.) </li><li>Looking at the Initial Challenge, is the steepness the same between any two consecutive steps?  (Yes. Illustrate the point by superimposing a graph on stairs showing points on the front edges.) Use <strong>Teaching Aid 4.1: Stairs on a Graph</strong>.  </li></ul><ol><li>Do these steps fit the carpenter guidelines? (2R + r = 24 and R + r = 18. So they do fit the carpenter guidelines.)</li><li>Are the points on the steps in a straight line?  (The points do lie on a straight line.)</li><li>Is the relationship between the rise and run a linear relationship? (The points do lie on a straight line. The relationship is r = 2R, which is linear. There would be a constant rate of change if we created a table.)</li><li>How is finding points on this line related to sketching a staircase with a rise-to-run ratio of 3 to 5? (Going from one point to another on the line is similar to moving 3 units vertically and then moving 5 units horizontally.) </li><li>Sketch a line that does not meet the carpenters’ guidelines. (Finding a line that does not meet the carpenters’ guidelines is an opportunity for students to test their understanding of the ratio of rise to run.) </li></ol><ul><li>Is Anna correct in What If Situation B?  (Yes)</li><li>Does the ratio change if we take two steps at a time? Explain why? (No. It is the essence of proportionality. For every 1 step…, for every 2 steps…)</li><li>In What If Situation C, how did you find the ratio of rise to run of the line with the points (3,5) and (-2,10)?  (Answers will vary.  Some students may see the idea of (y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>)/(x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>)   but they may not use this exact terminology and that is ok at this point; some students may draw a line connecting the two points and find the slope from the graph.  Some students may draw the line and make a table of points from the line and find the rate.  Use all of these in your summary to help students make connections between them.)</li></ul>"
