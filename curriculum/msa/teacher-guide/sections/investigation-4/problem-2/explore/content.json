If so what is it? (Yes. $4.50 per student and $1.25 per student for film rental.)</li><li>Is there a “starting point”? (0 and $130)</li><li>Which information is about income for the movie company? ($4.50 per student)</li><li>Which information is about expenses for the movie company? ($130 and $1.25 per student for film rental)</li><li>Would a graph be helpful? (Answers will vary.)</li><li>Would a table be helpful? (Answers will vary.)</li><li>What do we know about linear situations? (constant rate of change, straight line, y = mx +b )</li><li>How do you find where these ideas are equal on a table/graph/equation?  (on a table it is when the same value exists for the y-value at the same x-value; on a graph it is the point of intersection; using an equation you can use properties of equality and solve for x)</li></ul><p>Some students may use an income and expense expression and set them equal to each other to solve for x.  Some students may use a profit equation and subtract the income minus the expenses.</p><ul><li>For What If Situation B, what does &lt; mean? (less than)  &gt;? (greater than)</li><li>For What If Situation C, what was the Henri and Emile Race problem about?  The Cost of T-Shirts problem? (Henri and Emile were 2 brothers in a walking race and we needed to find out when they were at the same point so we could determine how long the race should be; the Cost of T-Shirts was when we looked at 2 companies and decided when they were the same price so we could decide which company had the best prices.)</li></ul>"
