Bring out how students were able to “tell the story” even when it wasn’t a constant rate of change. For example, with Graph D students can recognize that it isn’t linear because it isn’t a straight line.  They can find values for the points (1, 1); (2,2); (3,4).  This will match with Table T and context M with the trivia game.)</li><li>Look at all the cards.  Which cards represented a positive rate of change/slope? (Graph B, Graph C, Equation G, Equation I, Equation J, Context K, Context N, Context P, Table T, Table U, Table V)</li><li>Look at all the cards.  Which cards represent proportional relationships? (Graph C, Equation J, Context K, Graph E)</li></ul>"
