            "<h3>Problem Overview</h3><p>Students explore constant rate and y-intercept in a new context. They find solutions to equations. Students solve problems and make decisions about linear relationships and inequalities using information given in tables, graphs, and equations. This problem formally introduces the words <em>solutions of an equation</em>. Students learn to recognize a linear relationship within a contextual situation, from an equation, table, or graph. </p>"
