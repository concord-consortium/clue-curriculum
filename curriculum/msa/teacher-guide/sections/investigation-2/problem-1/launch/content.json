            "<h3>Problem Overview</h3><p>Students look at the context of a young boy challenging his older brother to a race. Students explore the question, “How long should the race be so that the younger brother wins in a close race?” This Problem introduces the idea of students finding the point of intersection of two linear relationships using a graph, a table, or numeric reasoning. The Problem also assesses what students have learned about linear relationships and their representations from Investigation 1. </p><p><strong>Implementation Note:</strong> You might have a short summary after the Initial Challenge. This will give students a chance to share their strategies and how they made sense of the race question before going on to answer more detailed questions. You may want to use the What If...? questions to push the conversation during the Summarize. Ask the questions and pause for students to think about and record their answers, then engage the class in a discussion of ideas.</p>"
