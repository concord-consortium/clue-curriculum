(Plan 1: +5 dollars per kilometer; Plan 2: -1 dollar per kilometer; Plan 3: +0 dollars per kilometer)  </li><li>How does each rate appear in a table? In a graph? In an equation? (In a table, the rate is the constant change in the amount of money raised when the number of kilometers increases by 1. In a graph, the rate is the steepness of the line. In an equation, the rate is the coefficient of x.) </li><li>What information does the y-intercept represent in each plan? (The y-intercept represents the amount of money a sponsor donates for 0 kilometers walked. If the person did not walk at all, he or she would still raise an amount of money equal to the y-intercept.)  </li><li>Do the plans make sense? Explain. (Answers may vary. Sample answers: Plan 1 makes sense because the walker is asking each sponsor to donate $5 per kilometer and then gives the sponsor something that costs $3, such as a T-shirt. Plan 2 does not make sense because the amount of money raised should not decrease as the number of kilometers walked increases. Plan 3 makes sense because the walker raises $2 from each sponsor regardless of the distance walked, which is similar to Leanne’s plan in Problem 1.3.) </li></ul>"

            "<p>Let students share their ideas with the main focus on the rate, intercepts of the graphs, and solutions of the equations. Most students will say that the negative rate does not make sense. It means you give money back. However, students are very creative and may suggest something plausible. Another suggestion could be that the walker for Plan 2 collects $6 and promises to walk 15 kilometers. If she does not walk the 15 km, then she will pay back $1 for each kilometer she does not walk. In this case, it is necessary to change what the variable <em>x</em> represents to the number of kilometers <em>not </em>walked.</p><p>Plan 2 is linear, decreasing, and not proportional. Can a linear relationship be decreasing and still be proportional? (Yes. It would not make sense for a pledge plan because we would lose money the more we walked. An example graph could contain the points: (0,0), (1,-2), (2,-4), (3,-6), (4, -8), etc.)</p>"
