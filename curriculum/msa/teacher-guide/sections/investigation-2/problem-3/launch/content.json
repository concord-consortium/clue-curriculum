            "<h3>Problem Overview</h3><p>Students investigate various pledge plans from sponsors of the walkathon. The plans are represented by equations. In this Problem, students identify the constant rate of change from various representations. They decide whether the graph of a linear relationship is decreasing, increasing, or staying the same from different representations of the relationship. They decide if the relationships are proportional. They also begin to make the connections among the points on a line, the pairs of data in a row of a table, and a solution of an equation of the form <em>y = b + ax</em>. This latter goal provides a transition to solving equations using algebraic methods. </p>"

            "<p><strong>Emerging Mathematical Ideas</strong></p><p>Continue working to develop strategies for finding solutions for linear relationships using multiple representations including: graphs, tables, equations, and inequalities. The focus of Problem 2.3 is to make connections between solutions found using one representation (e.g., graphs) to each of the other representations (e.g., tables and equations) where they are also visible. Look for patterns connecting solutions for a linear relationship found on a graph, table, equation, or inequality to solutions found using other representations including:</p><ul><li>the coordinates of a point (<em>a, b</em>) on the graph of a line is a solution for the linear relationship. The ordered pair (<em>a, b</em>) can also be found as a corresponding pair of values on a table representing solutions for the line, and when the equation is evaluated at <em>x = a</em>, the value found for <em>y </em>will be equal to <em>b</em>.</li></ul><p>Notice that answering some questions about a linear relationship can be easier or harder depending on the representation. For example,</p><ul><li>it can be harder to find rate of change for a linear relationship on a graph or table than it is to find it using an equation, or</li><li>it can be easier to find the solution (y value) for a linear relationship for a given value of the independent variable using a table or a graph.</li></ul><p>Identify and represent proportional relationships as tables, graphs, and equations and distinguish from non-proportional linear relationships.</p>"

(Sample questions: How far did Alana walk if a sponsor donates 12 dollars? How much money would Alana raise from each sponsor if she walked 14 kilometers?)</li><li>How can you use the equation for Alana’s plan to check the answer to the question you wrote? (The equation for Alana’s plan is <em>A</em> = 5 + 0.5<em>d</em>. For the first question, if you substitute 12 for A in the equation and solve for<em>d</em>, you will find the number of kilometers. For the second question, if you substitute 14 for<em>d</em> in the equation and solve for <em>A</em>, you will find how much each sponsor pledges.)</li><li>How can you use a graph to find the number of kilometers that Alana walked if each sponsor donated $17? (You can find 17 on the <em>y</em>-axis and move horizontally until you reach a point on the line. Then, you move vertically down until you hit the <em>x</em>-axis. The value on the <em>x</em>-axis is the number of kilometers walked.)</li></ul><p>Ask the class to show how the questions relate to solving the equation<em> A</em> = 5 + 0.5<em>d</em> when the value of one variable is known.

Students should begin to see that there are an infinite number of coordinate pairs that are solutions of <em>A</em> = 5 + 0.5<em>d</em>.
