            "<p>If you have an equation of the form y = ax + b and you know the value of x or y, you can substitute the value of the variable into the equation. Then, use the properties of equality to solve for the other variable. For example, if y = 3x + 4 and you want to find x when y = 10, then you substitute 10 in place of y: 10 = 3x + 4. Next, you can subtract 4 from both sides to get 6 = 3x. Now, divide both sides by 3 to get x = 2.</p><p>For the equation y = 3x + 4, to find the value of x when y = 10, you can graph the equation. Trace along the line to find the point whose y-coordinate is 10 and then read the corresponding x-value, which is 2.</p><p>To use a table, construct a table of values for the equation either by hand or with graphing technology. Next, locate the pair of values in which y = 10, and find the corresponding x-value, which is 2.</p><p>To find the values that satisfy an inequality such as 3x + 4 &lt; 10, you can solve the corresponding equation 3x + 4 = 10. The solution of this equation is x = 2. Then, test values less than and greater than 2 to determine the solution. In this case, x-values less than 2 make the inequality 3x + 4 &lt; 10 true, so the solution is x &lt; 2.</p><p>To find the values that satisfy an inequality such as 3x + 4 &lt; 10, you can graph the corresponding linear relationship y = 3x + 4. Then, find the points on the line whose y-values are less than 10. You can also locate the x-values of these points on the x-axis or on a number line.</p><p>In Problem 3.2, Equation 1, two equivalent expressions for the number of pouches on the left side of the equation are 4x + 2 and 2(2x + 1). You can use the properties of operations to show that they are equivalent. Applying the Distributive Property to one of the expressions yields the other: 4x + 2 = 2(2x + 1). You can also argue that both of the expressions represent the number of pouches and coins in the picture.</p><p>In Problem 3.3, Set 3(a), two equivalent ways of writing the expression on the left side of the equation are 3(x + 1) and 3x + 3. You can tell they are equivalent because the equations 3(x + 1) = 21 and 3x + 3 = 21 have the same solution, even though you would take different steps when solving them. (To solve the first equation, you would divide each side by 3 and then subtract 1 from each side. To solve the second equation, you would subtract 3 from each side and then divide each side by 3. The solution for both equations is x = 6.)</p>"
