            "<p>Climbing stairs is good exercise, so some athletes run up and down stairs as part of their training. Some students in Ms. Changâ€™s class decided to run up and down stairs to prepare for their Walkathon. The steepness of stairs determines how difficult they are to climb. By investigating the steepness of stairs, we can find another important way to describe the steepness of a line. Carpenters have developed the guidelines below to ensure that the stairs they build are relatively easy for a person to climb. Steps are measured in inches. </p><ul><li>The run plus twice the rise should be between 24 and 26 inches.</li></ul><ul><li>The rise plus the run for each step should be between 17 and 19 inches.</li></ul><p>The steepness of stairs is determined by the ratio of the rise to the run for each step. The rise and run are labeled in the photo below.</p>"
