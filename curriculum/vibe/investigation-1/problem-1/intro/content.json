            "<p><strong>Overview: </strong></p><p>Throughout this unit, we will explore how bionic arms work. Bionic arms are designed for people with limb differences (e.g., people who lost a limb as a result of an accident). With recent developments in science and engineering, these individuals can now directly control a prosthetic arm as if it was their own biological arm. Throughout the unit, you will also learn about the engineering design process: what do engineers do and how their work can help people.</p><p><strong>Learning Objectives: </strong></p><p>This activity is intended to help you come up with questions about how body systems interact with one another and with technology. </p>"
