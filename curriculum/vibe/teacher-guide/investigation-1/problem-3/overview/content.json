            "<p>In this lesson, students will explore the structure of the nervous system and test their nervous system by investigating how fast they react to objects. Students will also develop their computational thinking by creating a simple DataFlow program that makes a simulated gripper open and close.  </p><p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p><p>1. Students will describe the general structure of the nervous system.</p><p>2. Students will measure their reaction time and discuss how their reaction time is affected by the nervous system. </p><p>3. Students will develop a computer simulation of a simple bionic arm. </p><p><strong>NGSS Alignment</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.nextgenscience.org/pe/hs-ls1-2-molecules-organisms-structures-and-processes\">NGSS HS-LS1-2</a></p><p>This activity also supports Common Core English Language Arts Standards – <a href=\"http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/RST/9-10/\">Disciplinary Literacy Science, 9-10.</a></p><p><strong>Formative Assessment</strong></p><p>Students’ models and discussions; Learning Journals</p><p><strong>Materials</strong></p><p>A 30 cm ruler for every two students. </p>"
