The following comments come from:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/10/five-smart-things-honeybees-can-do\">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/10/five-smart-things-honeybees-can-do</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3629984/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3629984/</a></p><p>These insects’ brains are tiny, but they know numbers and communication. </p><p><u>Crunch numbers</u></p><p>Scientists found that honeybees can<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/06/spelling-bees-no-but-they-can-do-arithmetic-say-researchers\"> learn to add and subtract</a>. Fourteen bees were put through 100 training exercises. They were correct 64% – 72% of the time. “It is not that every bee could do this, but we could teach them to do it,” said Dr. Adrian Dyer, research co-author.</p><p><u>Solve tasks</u></p><p>In 2017, researchers from Queen Mary University of London <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aag2360\">demonstrated</a> that bees can learn to gain a reward and then show others to do the same. The bees were taught by a decoy bee to move a small ball to a particular location – and some of them even managed to solve the task more efficiently by shortening the distance.</p><p><u>Give directions</u></p><p>Karl von Frisch was awarded the 1973 Nobel Prize for decoding the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance\">waggle dance</a>” performed by bees to tell hive-mates the location of food sources. A bee vibrates its wings to relay information about the location of food in relation to the position of the sun.</p><p><u>Understand zero </u></p><p>Honeybees were the first insect species to be observed to have <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/06/180607141031.htm\">a concept of zero</a>, a numerical idea that many find difficult to learn. Researchers at RMIT University in Melbourne showed that bees conceive zero as a number, but they were unclear why they had this skill.</p><p><u>Share decisions</u></p><p>Bees have a sense of democracy. When looking for a new home for, say 10,000 bees, 300 older bees <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/science/28scibks.html\">form a “senate”</a> and fly off looking for options. Using the waggle dance, they communicate possible locations. The number of dance repetitions tells the quality of the site.</p>"
