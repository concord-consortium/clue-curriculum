              "<p>Research has shown that honeybees give each other directions to flowers by performing a lively dance! Karl von Frisch was awarded the 1973 Nobel prize for decoding how the dance uses angles to communicate to hive-mates the location of pollen and nectar sources. </p><p>Honeybees live in colonies. Each colony has a single queen and thousands of worker bees. The worker bees find flowers to gather nectar and pollen. The nectar is used to make honey. Worker bees build the honeycomb and keep the beehive clean. They take care of the queen bee and the young. They also guard the hive against intruders. </p><p>On returning to the hive, a bee does a dance to communicate the direction to flowers. The dance is called the waggle dance because of the way the bee moves. </p><p>To the bees, straight up represents the position of the sun.</p><p>The bee waggles at an angle away from the sun. This shows the direction to the flowers. The bee repeats the angle, making two semicircles as it turns. The length of the straight run is proportional to the distance to the food source.</p><p>Unlike bees, we need tools to measure angles. Two common tools for measuring angles are an angle ruler and a protractor.</p>"
