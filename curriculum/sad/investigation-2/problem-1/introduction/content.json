            "<p><strong>Investigation 2</strong></p><p><strong>Designing with Angles</strong></p><p>In Investigation 1 we used experiments to gain information about relationships among the side lengths of triangles and quadrilaterals and which of the shapes were rigid. We collected data and represented the data using tables. We used the patterns we found in the data to model and make predictions about the shapes. Experiments often start with a question that is answered by conducting an experiment to collect data, representing the data, looking for patterns, making predictions, and drawing conclusions.</p><p>In the grade 6 unit <em>Data About Us</em>, we used representations such as bar graphs, line plots, histograms, and box plots to look more closely at the variability among the data. As we move through the year, we will continue to use data and modeling to solve problems. In the <em>Samples and Population</em> unit, we will look at ho to draw samples of data to represent a population.</p><p>In this investigation, we will look at angles. We will use this knowledge to explore how angles affect shape in Investigation 3.</p><p>Many Olympic events feature athletes performing exciting flips and spins, including gymnastics, figure skating, snowboarding, and aerial skiing. Judges, competitors, and fans describe the challenge of a flip or spin with numbers like 180, 360, 540, 720, 900, and 1,080. </p>"
