            "<p><u>Making the Mathematics Explicit</u></p><p>Students should be able to explain why there are only three regular polygons that tile, using angle measure as part of their argument. These are the only three regular polygons with an angle measure that is a factor of 360. They should also be able to explain why certain combinations of regular polygons work, using angle measures. Be sure to ask them to show why they think their design forms a tiling with no gaps or overlaps. One simple example is octagons and squares: The interior angle in a regular octagon is 135°, so two octagons would be 270°, and adding an angle from the square would make the necessary 360°.</p>"

(We cannot fit them in together. There are gaps or the shapes overlaps. The angle measures do not add to 360˚.)</li><li>How did finding the shapes that tile help you with thinking about angle measurements? (Answers will vary. Some students have discussed how knowing when a shape tessellated it connected at 360° helped them to have more visuals for some benchmark angle measurements.)</li><li>Since we know that triangles, squares, and hexagons tile, what does this tell us about the measure of the angles if those are regular shapes? (Like Maisie, if we know the shapes fit together at a point there is 360˚. Since the shapes are regular, all the angles are equal measure and equally share the 360˚.)</li><li>What is the measure of one angle in a regular triangle? A square? A regular hexagon? (60˚, 90˚, and 120˚.)</li><li> What other combinations of shapes tile? (Answers will vary.)</li></ul>"
