            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>This Problem uses results about angle measurement in polygons to explain the tiling properties of polygons. The use of tessellations or tiling will help to solidify ideas that students are forming around characteristics of shapes and in particular angle measurements.</p><p>Implementation Note: The shapes are a subset of the Shape Set. If you have Shape Sets, you can use them. Otherwise, you will have to use copies cut from the Learning Aid or develop an electronic solution.</p>"

You can use Teaching Aid 3.1: Honeycombs. Ask where they might have seen a similar pattern of hexagons, since it is a very common tile pattern. After discussing hexagon patterns, ask the following questions.</p>"

Let them conjecture and formalize this during the Summary. In a regular hexagon each angle measures 120° so when three hexagons meet, there is a total rotation of 360° around the intersection of the three sides.)</li><li>What other polygons do you think can be used to tile a surface? (Students will make many conjectures. Encourage them to explain their thinking and then they will investigate these in this Problem.)</li></ul>"
