            "<p><u><strong>Explore (Digging In)</strong></u></p><p><u>Providing for Individual Needs</u></p><p>This Problem takes an experimental approach to the question about angle sums in polygons to give students more information as they become more proficient in constructing geometric shapes. Students are guided to make measurements of the regular polygons and to look for patterns in those measurements.</p><p>For students who may need an adaptation for tearing the angles off and keeping track matching the angles around one point, you could try two other methods. Example 1 below shows folding the shape to match-up the angles. Students will need to number the angles on both sides of their triangle. Then, the angles can be folded-in to show that the sum of the angles of a triangle create a 180˚ angle. Example 2 below shows comparing the angles to a straight angle of 180˚. Students will need to number the angles on both sides of their shape. They can combine, compare, and estimate the angles as they compare to a straight angle.</p>"

            "<p>In Trevor’s method, check that students see how the angles of subdividing triangles actually add up to the angles of the polygon. To assist some groups in moving their conversation forward around seeing that the sum of the angles of a polygon is equal to the sum of the angles in (n - 2) triangles, you can suggest numbering the angles of the triangles using Devon’s method. (Portrayal)</p><p>In Casey’s method, check that students see how the subdivision into triangles actually includes 360° that are not part of the polygon angles (around the center point). A similar numbering to Devon’s method may also help with Casey’s method. Some students may need to be reminded that the sum of the angles around a point is 360º.</p>"
