            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>The goal of this Problem is to add another piece of information that will help students in constructing geometric shapes by developing a formula that predicts the sum of interior angles for a polygon of n sides, especially the instances of that pattern for triangles (180°) and quadrilaterals (360°). Knowing these angle sums is important for determining missing angles in constructing triangles and quadrilaterals. For example, if you know that two angles of a triangle are 70º and 50º, then the other angle is 180º – 120º, or 60º. Students begin by examining angle sums of any polygon. Then they look specifically at regular polygons and make an important generalization about the angle sum property. The Problem offers different strategies for making and confirming that generalization. While you might find it unnecessary to use all the strategies for thinking about angle sums, each approach is an illustration of a very important practice in geometry—cutting a given figure into smaller pieces (preferably triangles) and showing how the properties of those pieces can be used to get results about the whole figure.</p><p>Implementation Note: Divide the class into three groups for What If Situation A. One group will investigate Trevor’s strategy, one group will investigate Casey’s strategy and one group will investigate Maria’s strategy.</p><p>For What If Situation B divide the shapes among groups in the class. Groups can share their findings in the Summary. (Problem Solving Environment)</p>"
