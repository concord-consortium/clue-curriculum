            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>The objective of this problem is to develop student understanding of the conditions that determine unique shapes. This is the foundation for subsequent work on similarity and congruence later on. The storyline of the problem is a challenge to convey a lot of information with only a few words to produce a unique triangle. For example, if the three corresponding side lengths of two triangles are equal, the triangles are congruent (SSS Theorem). This property of congruence is what makes triangles rigid and useful in building. Similarly, if two angles and the included side are congruent to the corresponding angles and included side of another triangle, the triangles are congruent (ASA Theorem).</p>"
