            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>The goal of Problem 3.3 is to add another piece of information that will help students in constructing geometric shapes by developing student understanding of the concept of exterior angle and to apply that idea to reasoning from another perspective, about interior angles of polygons. Defining interior and exterior angles is a nontrivial task. It may be helpful for students to see that the interior and exterior angles at a vertex are always supplementary. An interesting fact emerges—the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is always 360º. Intuitively, this may not be surprising. That is, if you start at one vertex and walk completely around the polygon to the starting vertex, you have in essence done a 360º rotation.</p><p>In all of the preceding work with angles and polygons, we have focused student attention on convex figures, making all interior angles of measure less than 180°. As the star and arrowhead polygons shown in the Student Edition indicate, there are some figures that seem to qualify as polygons but involve interior angles greater than a straight angle. These shapes are briefly visited as an interesting contrast.</p>"

By doing this, students should be clear about the concept of exterior angles. Point out that there are two possible exterior angles at any vertex of a polygon. When looking for a pattern in the measures of exterior angles for any specific polygon, it will help to study angles that are drawn in a consistent direction (counterclockwise or clockwise). Although students have been told to measure angles counterclockwise, Figure 2 shows walking around a polygon in a clockwise direction. If students notice this, you can discuss that they can think of these angles as having the same measurement. The important thing is that the sides have to be extended in the same direction – either all clockwise or all counterclockwise.</p><p>Show the class an example of an exterior and interior angle of a polygon.  These two angles come in pairs. Students might note that the sum of their measures is 180º. The interior and exterior angles at a vertex are always supplementary.</p>"
