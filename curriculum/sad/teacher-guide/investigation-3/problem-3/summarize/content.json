            "<p><u>Making the Mathematics Explicit </u></p><p><strong>Suggested Questions</strong></p><ul><li>What is an exterior angle of a triangle? (An exterior angle is an angle at a vertex of a triangle made by extending one side of the triangle. The angle between the extended side and the side of the triangle is an exterior angle. An exterior angle is always adjacent to and supplementary to an interior angle.)</li><li>What is the sum of the exterior angles in any polygon? How do you know? (360º. The exterior angles of a triangle, whether added clockwise or counterclockwise, make a full circle.)</li><li>What pattern do you see in the sizes of the interior angles as the number of sides increases? (The sizes of the angles are increasing. They were getting closer and closer to 180°.)</li><li>Will they ever equal or be greater than 180°? (No. If they are equal to 180°, then the angles would all lie on a straight line and there would be no polygon. Since the polygon is regular, if one angle is greater than 180°, then all of the angles are greater than 180°. In this case, there would be no way to connect the sides to form a polygon.)</li><li>What happens to the shape of the polygon? (It becomes more and more like a circle.)</li><li>How did you find the measures of the angles represented by w, x, y and z in What If Situation B?  (Answers will vary.  Sample solution shown below)</li></ul>"
