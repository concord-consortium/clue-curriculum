            "<p><strong>Student Responses</strong></p><p>At the beginning of the year, students will need more collaboration to outline and summarize the important ideas. They may need examples of writing, diagrams, and/or justifications from other students to help build their version of what is expected when answering a Mathematical Reflection. Early in the year, you may want to start writing Mathematical Reflections as a whole group. Then as the year progresses, move to small groups, pairs, and finally individuals.</p><p>Each investigation contributes to students&#x27; conceptual understandings of the ideas in the unit. Students&#x27; explanations at the beginning of the unit might be just forming. As you progress through the unit, students can use the contexts, representation, and connections to express a more solid understanding. By the end of the unit, students can create a complete picture of understanding.</p><p><strong> Example Strategies for Student Participation</strong></p><p>Here are a few creative strategies teachers use to encourage students&#x27; ownership of their learning.</p>"
