They may need examples of writing, diagrams, and/or justifications from other students to help build their version of what is expected when answering a Mathematical Reflection. Early in the year, you may want to start writing Mathematical Reflections as a whole group.

Students&#x27; explanations at the beginning of the unit might be just forming. As you progress through the unit, students can use the contexts, representation, and connections to express a more solid understanding.
