Continue to rotate one of the polystrips (or opening the angle ruler), creating a larger and larger angle. Stop after a 45°, 90°, 135°, and 180° angle and ask about the measure of each angle. Now have students look at the grid on the right and ask:</p><ul><li>What are the measures of some of the angles in this grid? (Point out the 30°, 60°, 90°, 120° angles and so on. Help students to see that the angles are all multiples of 30°.)</li><li>Using these grids, describe a point by giving two numbers. The first number tells how far to move from the center of the grid. The second number tells the amount of turn measured in degrees. How would I find the point (3, 90°)? (Using either grid, help students to see that to locate this point, you move out three units in the positive direction along the 0° line (x-axis) and then rotate counterclockwise 90° along that circle.)</li></ul><p>The Four in a Row game will help students develop just that angle sense. You might find it helpful to play one game with the teacher against the whole class first in order to make the rules clear. If students suggest a pair of numbers that don’t work, the teacher can dramatically show how it falls off the grid. Then, suggest that students play several more games in the Initial Challenge before moving on to the rest of the Problem.
