Take time to explore all the strategies they used to arrive at their answers. You may want to display benchmark strategies for students to refer to as they proceed through the Unit.</p><p>Have students record their measurements for some of the angles. Look for large discrepancies. If large discrepancies occur, have the group measure again. (Portrayal)  Discuss what might account for any differences in the measurements. Students do not need to agree on the degree measurements, but their measurements should be close. In this discussion, students will begin to understand the issues involved in making precise measurements; relate this to the fateful journey of Amelia Earhart.  You might want to ask students for their suggestions for getting a more accurate measurement using the angle ruler.</p><p>As you discuss the angle measures, you may ask which angles are acute, obtuse, or right, to review these ideas from elementary school. (Language)</p><p>Encourage students to try both the angle ruler and protractor.</p>"

            "<p><strong>Suggested Questions</strong></p><ul><li>How do you decide the number of degrees for angles between the 5° intervals on the angle ruler? (Answers will vary.  One possibility- I use the degree marks on the arm of the ruler and line up the zero with a 5° mark.)</li><li>What things do you check to make sure you are making accurate measurements?  (Answers will vary.  One possibility: I check that the rivet is over the vertex and the centerline of the ruler arm is over the initial side.  Then, I rotate the other arm counterclockwise until it lines up over the terminal side.) </li><li>We didn’t always get the same measurements.  Why did this happen?  (Measurements are not exact.  Discuss possible sources of error.  Stress that these tools may provide more accurate measures of angles than estimating, but they do not provide exact measures. No measuring tool is absolutely precise, so there is a little error in every measurement.)</li><li>Which tool do you prefer for measuring angles? Why? (Answers will vary.)</li></ul>"
