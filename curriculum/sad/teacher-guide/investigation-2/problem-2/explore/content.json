            "<p><strong>Explore (Digging In)</strong></p><p><em>Providing for Individual Needs</em></p><p>As students use an angle ruler, monitor their work to be sure that they are placing the angle ruler correctly and reading the measures accurately. Since the tool is easily flipped over and the arms interchanged, be aware of the importance of placing the arm with the scale on it down first. It needs to be placed over the initial side of the angle, with the rivet over the vertex, before rotating the other arm counterclockwise to the terminal side.</p><p>If students use a protractor, ask them to check their answer with the goniometer/angle ruler and vice versa. This gives them practice with both tools.</p><p>As you work with groups, look for interesting ways students reasoned for you to share in the summary.</p><p>The question about which direction the bee uses to indicate the location may come up. In the diagram, it is a counter clockwise, but it could be clockwise.  </p><p>As students are working on the What If...? Situation B table and equation about Amelia Earhartâ€™s journey, refer them back to their work with equations in grade 6, <em>Comparing Quantities</em> or <em>Variables and Patterns</em>.
