(Supplementary angles, vertical angles)</li><li>In What If Situation C, how did we write equations in <em>Variables and Patterns</em> in 6th grade? (Answers will vary. They will most likely discuss writing out generalizations to describe a situation in words and then shortening those words using letters into equations.)</li><li>In What If Situation C, how did we solve equations in<em> Bits of Rational</em> in 6th grade? (Answers will vary. Students don’t have a formal process as this time. This will get developed in Moving Straight Ahead later this year. They will most likely use fact families, guess and check, or “undoing what was done to x”.)</li></ul>"
