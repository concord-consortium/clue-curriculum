            "<p><strong>Suggested Questions:</strong></p><ul><li>Do any of the angles have the same measurement?  How do you know? (As students share angles with the same measurement help them to connect measurements ti the vocabulary word and the relationships in angles.)</li><li>Could any of the angles help you in finding the measurement of another angle? (As students are looking help them to use today&#x27;s vocabulary word to help them find measurements.) </li><li>Are there any “special” angles that could help you find relationships? (Supplementary, complementary, right angles, etc.)</li><li>Does measuring the angles help you to see any new relationships? (Answers will vary.  This might be when some see the congruence in vertical angles and/or the supplementary relationships.)</li><li>What relationships can help you find the measurements of the angles in What If...? Situation A? (Supplementary angles, vertical angles)</li><li>In What If...? Situation C, how did we write equations in <em>Variables and Patterns</em> in grade 6? (Answers will vary. They will most likely discuss writing out generalizations to describe a situation in words and then shortening those words using letters into equations.)</li><li>In What If...? Situation C, how did we solve equations in<em> Bits of Rational</em> in grade 6? (Answers will vary. Students don’t have a formal process as this time. This will get developed in <em>Moving Straight Ahead</em> later this year. They will most likely use fact families, guess and check, or “undoing what was done to x”.)</li></ul>"
