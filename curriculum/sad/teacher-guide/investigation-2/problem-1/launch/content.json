            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>The goals of this Problem are to develop student understanding of angles as rotations or turns, as a geometric shape, as well as their awareness of common benchmark angles, including those formed by the multiples of 30° and 45°. To help students estimate angle measure, a degree is defined as  1/90th of a right angle.  This Problem will confront directionality and build estimation skills for angle measurement. The Problem is also a review or introduction, depending on a student’s prior experience, of the conventions for labeling angles.</p><p><em>Implementation Note: After students have played the game several times and worked on the Initial Challenge questions, stop them and have a brief discussion before sending them off into the rest of the Problem. Be sure that students have the right idea about rotation and angle measurement, especially for angles larger than 90°. </em></p>"
