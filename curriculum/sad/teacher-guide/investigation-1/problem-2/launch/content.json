            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>The objective of this Problem is to extend the Triangle Inequality Property into a somewhat parallel result for quadrilaterals. The sum of any three side lengths of a quadrilateral is greater than the fourth side. If a quadrilateral can be built from four side lengths, different shapes of quadrilaterals can also be built from those four lengths. Also, the Problem reveals the fact that quadrilaterals are not rigid figures. A quadrilateralâ€™s shape will change in response to pressure on the vertex. This is why, when quadrilaterals are used in construction, it is common to see bracing, turning quadrilateral frames into linked triangles.</p>"
