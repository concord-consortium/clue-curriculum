            "<p><u>Making the Mathematics Explicit</u></p><p>Asking students to construct polystrips figures that demonstrate their thinking will be useful in making the general mathematical conclusions clear and convincing.</p><p>Have the groups report their findings and share their examples supporting their conclusions. You want them to leave the experience being able to explain what happened and able to design a quadrilateral from a set of side lengths as evidence supporting their findings.</p><p>A summary of strategies for finding different quadrilaterals from a given set of side lengths should come from the discussion. Two powerful strategies that focus on different aspects of what determines a quadrilateral are the following:</p><p>Put the set of lengths together in different orders. (This technique highlights the role of side lengths in determining a shape.)</p><p>Build a quadrilateral from polystrips. Alter its shape by pressing on the sides or vertices of the quadrilateral. A quadrilateral with any given side lengths can form an infinite number of different quadrilaterals. (This technique highlights the role of angles in determining a shape and the lack of rigidity for quadrilaterals.)</p><p>If four side lengths make a quadrilateral, the shape is not unique. Ask for examples of this and put them on the board or poster paper. As the discussion continues, add other examples with descriptions. (Portrayal)</p><p>Students should be able to determine that a parallelogram is formed if opposite side lengths are equal. The parallelogram will become a rectangle as the vertices are pushed to form right angles. Pushing further will change the rectangle to a nonrectangular parallelogram.</p><p>Finally, students should compare the relationships among side lengths of triangles with those of quadrilaterals. You may want to make a poster to show these findings. Include information about angle sums as well</p>"
