(Language)</p><p>Suggested questions</p><p>•What kinds of shapes do you see as you look at buildings and construction? (Answers will vary.)</p><p>•What is it that makes triangles so common in construction? (Answers will vary.)</p><p>If some students happen to know that triangles are rigid figures, you can segue into the Problem by suggesting that some exploration with the construction of triangles can help explain that property.  If no student suggests the fact about rigidity, you can simply suggest that building and testing the strength of some triangles will be helpful in understanding the phenomenon.  </p>"

            "<p><u>Presenting the Challenge</u><strong></strong></p><p>When using the polystrips to represent the length, help students to be conscientious. They need to be aware that it is the space between two holes that represents a length of one unit. We count the space (distance), not holes. For example, with fence posts - it takes three fence posts to hold up two lengths of fence. If we want to know how long the fence is, we count fence sections not posts.</p><p>You may want to number the holes, starting with zero on the polystrips so students can immediately find the given length. (Portrayal)</p><p>Distribute polystrips to groups of students.  If you don’t have polystrips you can make them using <strong>Learning Aid 1: Paper Polystrips</strong>. (Problem Solving Environment)</p><p>It is a good idea to demonstrate how to use the polystrips and how to make a triangle given the lengths. First, choose three numbers less than 20, such as 6, 8, 12.  Build a triangle with the polystrips using those numbers as side lengths. Then have each group build a 6-8-12 triangle.  Check to see that each group knows how to fasten the strips together to represent the lengths.  </p><p>Use Fist to Five to decide the comfort level that students have with using the polystrips before having them begin the problem.</p>"
