            "<p><u>Presenting the Challenge</u><strong></strong></p><p>When using the polystrips to represent the length, help students to be conscientious. They need to be aware that it is the space between two holes that represents a length of one unit. We count the space (distance), not holes. For example, with fence posts - it takes three fence posts to hold up two lengths of fence. If we want to know how long the fence is, we count fence sections not posts.</p><p>You may want to number the holes, starting with zero on the polystrips so students can immediately find the given length. (Portrayal)</p><p>Distribute polystrips to groups of students or use digital polystrips in the Graph tool.  If you donâ€™t have polystrips you can make them using <strong>Learning Aid 1: Paper Polystrips</strong>. (Problem Solving Environment)</p><p>It is a good idea to demonstrate how to use the polystrips and how to make a triangle given the lengths. First, choose three numbers less than 20, such as 6, 8, 12.  Build a triangle with the polystrips using those numbers as side lengths. Then have each group build a 6-8-12 triangle.  Check to see that each group knows how to fasten the strips together to represent the lengths.  </p><p>Use Fist to Five to decide the comfort level that students have with using the polystrips before having them begin the problem.</p>"
