(Write the summary statement on the board. As students add to the discussion, revise the statement as improvements are suggested. Ask questions to stretch the students’ thinking until you have a rule that clearly distinguishes lengths that will work from those that won’t.) One good way to push their thinking in a situation like this is to make up examples to test. (Time) Give students the following sets of numbers: 4, 3, 5; 8, 2, 12; 8, 8, 4.</li><li> Which sets form a triangle? Why? (4, 3, 5 and 8, 8, 4 because the sum of any two sides is greater than the third.)</li><li>Do any of these triangles have special properties? Describe them. (8, 8, 4 is isosceles since it has two equal sides. 4, 3, 5 is a right triangle because it has one 90° angle.)</li><li>For What if Situation A, how could Geraldo make his triangular doorframe? (Have students demonstrate their answers with the Triangle Inequality Property or by making them with polystrips. He can make 3-3-3, 3-3-5, 5-5-6, 5-5-7, 3-5-6, 3-5-7,3-6-7, 5-6-7 triangles for the doorframe. The most likely solution is to make TWO 3-3-5 frames, one for the door and one for the rear.)</li><li>When you built your triangles, were you able to use the same side lengths to make a different triangle?

Before you share, tell them that they are not responsible for knowing the following yet.</p><p>Mathematicians talk about ideas at a general level rather than a specific one. For example, they name the lengths of a triangle’s sides rather than using specific side lengths such as 8cm, 6cm, 5cm. They give the sides of a triangle letters for names, such as side a, b, and c. So, a triangle with sides a, b, and c stands for any triangle you can make.
