            "<p><strong>Unit Description</strong></p><p><em>Shapes and Designs</em> is the second Unit in the CMP geometry strand. It develops students’ ability to recognize, display, analyze, measure, and reason about the shapes and visual patterns that are important features of our world. It builds on students’ elementary school exposure to simple shapes, as they begin analyzing the properties that make certain shapes unique. The Unit focuses on polygons and on the side length and angle measure relationships of regular and irregular polygons (circles and other curves are explored in later Units). A central theme is designing shapes under constraints. As students learn important criteria that determine shape, they apply these understandings to design figures with specific criteria and solve real world problems.</p><p>In the Student Edition, the introduction to <em>Shapes and Designs</em> develops the broad theme of the Unit: of all of the shapes we use as basic components in buildings and art, some simple figures occur again and again because certain properties make them especially attractive and useful. The goal of Shapes and Designs is to have students discover and analyze many of the key properties of polygonal shapes that make them useful and attractive. As students become observant of the multitude of shapes that surround them and aware of the reasons that shapes are used for specific purposes, they will be amazed by the visual pleasure and practical insights their new knowledge provides.</p><p>The approach to geometry in this Unit is somewhat unique. First, the primary focus of the Unit is on recognizing and generalizing properties of shapes that have important practical and aesthetic implications, not on simple classification and naming of figures. Each Investigation focuses on particular key properties of figures and the importance of those properties in applications. We frequently ask students to find and describe places where they see polygons of particular types and to puzzle over why those particular shapes are used.</p><p>The overarching goal of the Unit is to develop the broad principle that <em>form and function of natural and designed objects are intimately related</em>. To reach that goal, it is necessary to develop student understanding and skills that are useful in describing and reasoning about shapes, especially polygons. The shape and function of a polygon are determined by the combination of sides and angles used to construct it. However, some polygons, like triangles, are rigid and often appear in building structures. Quadrilaterals are not rigid but are useful for other parts of structures and in designing folding chairs.</p><p>The central question for this Unit is what important geometric properties determines a particular shape and how this information is useful in designing shapes given specific conditions. The focus is on generalizing the properties of shapes and how these properties are useful in nature and everyday life. Algebraic reasoning is more prominent as students use expressions and equations to solve problems involving angles and polygons. Bees are used as a theme to introduce and explore angles of rotation and again to look at shapes of polygons and why hexagons evolved as the shape for the cells of a honeycomb.</p><p>The Looking Ahead poses three important application questions that drive the Investigations and Problems: What properties of a regular hexagon make it the most efficient shape for the cells of a honeycomb? Why do some shapes occur more often than others in the design of craft objects? Why are braces on towers, roofs, and bridges in the shape of triangles and not rectangles or pentagons?</p>"

            "<p><strong>Summary of Investigations</strong></p><p><strong>Investigation 1 </strong>involves several STEM design experiments involving polystrips to explore the properties and usefulness of polygons are developed. Students discover the relationship among side lengths of polygons needed to build a polygon and which polygons have rigidity. They also sketch shapes given certain constraints about their side lengths.</p><p>Problem 1.1 focuses on developing the understanding of the Triangle Inequality Property, that in a triangle the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third.</p><p>Problem 1.2 extends the Triangle Inequality Property into a somewhat parallel result for quadrilaterals, that the sum of any three side lengths of a quadrilateral is greater than the fourth sides. Additionally, students see that a quadrilateral’s shape will change in response to pressure on the vertex and hence is not rigid. </p><p>Problem 1.3 looks at the minimum number of diagonals needed to make a shape rigid. Students add diagonals to various polygons to look at patterns of making a shape rigid by adding a triangular structure. A triangular shape is rigid which explains its popular use in the structure of bridges, buildings, etc.</p>"

            "<p><strong>Investigation 3</strong> develops fundamental concepts, terminology, and techniques needed to characterize size and shape of polygons, especially the relationship between angle measure and side lengths in polygons. It develops and applies important properties of polygons in order to explain tessellation, structural rigidity/flexibility, and its occurrence in nature. Students use algebraic reasoning to model quantities in the mathematical problem of finding total interior angle sums and the measure of each interior angle in regular and irregular polygons. Students also apply what they learned about angle measures to the concept of tessellations (tilings).  The Unit ends with several design under constraints experiments, which uses student knowledge of shapes that have been developed throughout the unit.</p><p>Problem 3.1 uses results about angle measurements in polygons to explain the tiling properties of regular hexagons.  Students are challenged to answer the question of “Why do the cells of honeycombs have the shape of hexagons?” The use of tessellations solidifies ideas that students are forming around characteristics of shapes, in particular angle measurements, and provides insights into why the bees choose the hexagon for the shape of their honeycombs</p><p>Problem 3.2 adds another piece of information that will help students to construct geometric shapes by developing a formula that predicts the sum of interior angles for a polygon of n sides, especially the instances of that pattern for triangles (180°) and quadrilaterals (360°). Knowing these angle sums is important for determining missing angles in constructing triangles and quadrilaterals. Students examine this relationship for convex and concave polygons.</p><p>Problem 3.3 uses the context of cycling around a field in the shape of a pentagon to find the number of degrees the cyclists makes in one full lap. Students develop an understanding of the concept of exterior angles. Using the concept of bicycling around polygonal paths students understand that the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is always 360°.</p><p>Problem 3.4 pulls together students understanding of the conditions that determine unique shapes. Given a set of design criteria about a shape, including its side lengths and angle measures, students determine if it possible to design such a shape. If it is, is it unique?</p><p>Throughout the Unit, students develop an understanding of shape and how it is used in design, art, building, and nature by designing, sketching, and building various shapes.</p>"

Compare this to the construction of a triangle. Once the side lengths are fixed the triangle is rigid. No pressure on a vertex can alter the angle sizes of the triangle. This makes triangles useful in the construction of houses, bridges etc. Quadrilaterals do not have this property. Four side lengths will not make the quadrilateral rigid. However, the flexibility of a quadrilateral with fixed side lengths makes it useful in other applications. For example, the trapezoid in the picture below changes shape while retaining the same side lengths. </p>"

(You can also see why parallelograms tile a plane in this figure.)</p><p></p><p><strong>Strategic Curriculum Connections</strong></p><p>Tiling is an opportunity to apply the knowledge about the sizes of angles in specific polygons, but it is also rich in connections to other units. </p><p><em>Why do only some regular polygons tile a plane?</em>  <em>The N Game</em> Connection: As illustrated above the sum of the angles around each vertex must be 360. Since all the angle measures are equal for a regular polygon, for a tiling each measure must be a factor of 360: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8…….45, 60, 72, 90, 120,180, 360. Could there be a regular polygon with <em>n</em> sides and <em>n</em> angles each measuring 45˚? Students may argue that as the number of sides in a regular polygon gets larger so does the angle size. So, if a regular polygon with 3 sides has angles of 60˚ then we would need to have fewer than 3 sides to make a regular polygon with angles of 45˚ – and you can’t make a polygon with fewer than 3 sides. (This can also be solved algebraically, though students are not able to do this yet.  A regular polygon with n sides has angle sum 180(<em>n</em> – 2). It also has <em>n</em> angles. If each angle is 45˚ then the angle sum is also 45<em>n</em>.  Solving 180(<em>n</em> – 2) = 45n gives n = 2 2/3, not a whole number of sides!) </p><p><em>Stretching and Shrinking</em> Connection: In <em>Shapes and Designs</em> students find that they can tile a plane with any triangle.
