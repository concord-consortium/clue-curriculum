They also found that given three side lengths that make a triangle, there is exactly one triangle. They learned that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°. In this Problem, they use this knowledge to look at the conditions that produce unique triangles and use their knowledge of angles to create other polygons.</p><p><em>Teacher Moves: Agency, Identity, Ownership</em></p><p>PRESENTING THE CHALLENGE</p><p>Launch the Problem by asking students, “Suppose you want to text a friend to give directions for drawing an exact copy of the figure. What is the shortest message to do the job?”</p><p>Have students brainstorm and share their ideas in their groups.</p><p>After some class discussion of approaches, you could segue to the Initial Challenge.
