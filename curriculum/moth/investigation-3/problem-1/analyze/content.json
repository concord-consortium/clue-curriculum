Note that when using the sorting menu, it is easy to see small discrepancies in how the data were recorded. For example, a misspelling of an entry will create a completely separate pile in sorting.  It can  then easily be corrected and will automatically sort itself into the correct pile, and will make any graph of the data clearer. This cleaning of data is a hallmark of data science.</p><p>Data cards can also be combined across groups to generate a <strong>class-wide dataset</strong> if desired. Students simply publish the data cards to make them available, and the data card tile can then be dragged into another workspace on combined with other tiles.</p><p></p>"
