            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>In this Problem, students use chip boards and number lines to explore contexts that involve subtraction of rational numbers. The goal is to give students experience in finding and representing differences of rational numbers. Students examine expressions involving rational numbers. As they work with these expressions and their contexts, students develop strategies for computing and representing subtraction with signed numbers. Students also explore the relationship between absolute value and the distance between two numbers on a number line.</p><p>In this Problem, students explore whether subtraction or addition with negative numbers is commutative. The Commutative Property seems obvious to many students because of their whole-number experience. However, it is important to examine cases in which the property does not work, such as subtraction.</p><p><strong>Implementation Note</strong>:  This problem will take two days.  Have a conversation after What If Situation A.  This will give students the opportunity to explore subtraction of integers and make some predictions about an algorithm.  The second day the students can refine this idea with the rest of the problem.</p>"
