            "<p><u>Teacher</u>: What do other groups think about the chipboard idea that Jeff’s group has started?</p><p><u>Kathy:</u> We did that too and did several more. When we looked at the number sentence we saw a pattern. The color with the largest number of chips on the board was always the sign of the sum. Like in 4 + - 6 there are more red chips than black, so the sum was going to be negative.</p><p><u>Teacher:</u> Is this always true?</p><p><u>Tatiana:</u> Yes. We found the same thing, but we also found out that when you have two different colors, if you just subtract the numbers then look at which color had the most, you have the full answer. Using the one Kathy talked about 4 + -6, you just subtract 6 and 4, which is 2, and since there are more red chips than black chips the sum is -2.  </p><p><u>Jeff</u>: You guys are right! That works for all of the chipboards we did.  </p><p><u>Teacher</u>: What if we used the number line model for the situations Jeff started us looking at?</p><p><u>Yvonne</u>: We used number lines. Let me try it with 4 + -6. (Yvonne draws it on the board) We found the same idea that Tatiana was talking about. When the signs are different, you are subtracting because you end up starting in one direction on the number line and then reversing the direction with the number that is a different sign. It was like you were taking some of those away that you first did.  </p>"
