            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>Students are introduced to the idea of an algorithm and challenged to develop an algorithm for addition of rational numbers. They use chip board and number line models to make sense of the operation and understand its effect on positive and negative numbers. The goal is to engage the students in concrete ways of representing and solving the problems. Students move from concrete representations to addition algorithms that support efficient operations on rational numbers. They also encounter and use the Commutative Property of Addition.</p>"

(a • 1 = a, a ÷ 1 = a, a – 0 = a)</li><li>How have we found additive identity helpful so far?  (On a chip board, we could find amounts equal to zero.  Then we could know the value represented on the board.  For example: a board that had 10 red chips and 3 black chips:  -7 + (-3 + 3) = -7)</li><li>How can you write a sum of two numbers that results in a sum of -5? (One strategy is to choose two negative addends with absolute values that add to 5. For example, -2 + -3 = -5 and -4 + -1 = -5. Another strategy is to make one addend positive and the other negative but choose a negative number whose absolute value is 5 greater than the positive number. For example, -10 + 5 = -5 and 25 + -30 = -5. Students can also think of this method as choosing a negative number that is 5 units farther from zero on a number line than the positive addend is.)</li></ul>"
