            "<p><em>Presenting the Challenge</em></p><p>Hold a discussion of the conventions for the Order of Operations and the computations given. </p><p>Talk a bit about the use of parentheses with your students. Make sure that they understand parentheses as a grouping symbol. This means that you need to compute what is in the parentheses first. It also means that, when you write expressions to match word problems, you can insert parentheses to make sure that the expressions you write reflect the order of operations that you intend. For example, for the expression 5 + (-2) x (-3), you get 11 if you follow the Order of Operations. However, suppose you want the expression to mean adding first and then multiplying. You can insert parentheses to override doing multiplication before addition. Then (5 + (-2)) x (-3) = -9 because you compute the expression in parentheses first. </p><p>Also remind students that when you need grouping symbols such as parentheses inside parentheses, you can use brackets to make it easier to read. So, (5 + (-2)) becomes [5 + (-2)].</p><p></p><p>Have students work in groups of 3-4 to play the <em>Dealing Up</em> game in the Initial Challenge and then work on the What If...? Situations. Pass out the set of cards from <strong>Learning Aid 4.1A:  Dealing Up Cards</strong> and one scoresheet using <strong>Learning Aid 4.1B:  Scoresheet for Dealing Up</strong> to each group. </p>"
