Make sure that they understand parentheses as a grouping symbol. This means that you need to compute what is in the parentheses first. It also means that, when you write expressions to match word problems, you can insert parentheses to make sure that the expressions you write reflect the order of operations that you intend. For example, for the expression 5 + (-2) x (-3), you get 11 if you follow the Order of Operations. However, suppose you want the expression to mean adding first and then multiplying. You can insert parentheses to override doing multiplication before addition. Then (5 + (-2)) x (-3) = -9 because you compute the expression in parentheses first. </p><p>Also remind students that when you need grouping symbols such as parentheses inside parentheses, you can use brackets to make it easier to read. So, (5 + (-2)) becomes [5 + (-2)].</p><p></p><p>Have students work in groups of 3-4 to play The Game Dealing Up in the Initial Challenge and then work on the What If Situations.  Pass out the set of cards from L<strong>earning Aid 4.1A:  Dealing Up Cards</strong> and one scoresheet using <strong>Learning Aid 4.1B:  Scoresheet for Dealing Up</strong> to each group. </p>"
