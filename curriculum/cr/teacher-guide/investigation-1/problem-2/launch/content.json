            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>Students write number sentences and sketch number lines, both vertical and horizontal, to compare temperatures. (Portrayal) They encounter changing temperatures and determine the resulting temperature. Students are not expected to solve these problems by following specific algorithms for signed numbers. They use informal arithmetic reasoning to connect direction and distance to the number line, and then represent their reasoning with number sentences. In this Problem, students focus on both distance and direction as they seek to describe changes in temperature and represent these changes with number sentences.</p><p><strong>Teacher Note</strong>: In Investigation 2, students will develop algorithms for addition and subtraction of integers. To prepare for this collect number sentences that they use in Investigation 1 in digital Learning Logs or on posters like these:  </p>"

Some students may recall experiencing the movement of a cold front (a decrease in outside temperature) or a heat wave (an increase in temperature). Changes are often more subtle, as the outside temperature usually rises and falls in a more predictable way. Most students will be aware that morning temperatures are often cooler than afternoon temperatures. They may also recall feeling changes in temperature when jumping into a lake, a pool, or the ocean.
