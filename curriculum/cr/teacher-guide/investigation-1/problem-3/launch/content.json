            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>Students model addition and subtraction on chip-board displays. Students explore relationships between addition and subtraction as well. One chip color indicates positive values, and the other chip color indicates negative values.</p><p>This Problem promotes informal experiences with addition and subtraction of signed numbers. Investigation 2 will formalize algorithms for completing these operations. Note that this model is a representation of integer arithmetic, while the directed distance (number line) model from Problems 1.1 and 1.2 is a continuous model that can represent fraction and decimal numbers and lengths. This chip model lends itself to the take-away interpretation of subtraction.</p><p><u>Teacher Note</u>: In Investigation 2, students will develop algorithms for addition and subtraction of integers. To prepare for this collect number sentences that they use in Investigation 1 in digital Learning Logs or on posters like these: </p>"

Display Amber’s chipboard that is in the Student Edition. Give partners a set of two-color chips. Launch students into the Problem to investigate chipboard situations. Have students work in groups of 2. Have 2 color chips and chip boards available for students to use as they are working on the problem.</p><p>What If Situation D is playing The Game of Zero. Ideally you would want students to play this in teams or if you are short on time you can play this as a whole class. If you are playing this in teams, <strong>Distribute Learning Aid 1.3A: Cards</strong> and <strong>Learning Aid 1.3B: Recording Sheet</strong>.
