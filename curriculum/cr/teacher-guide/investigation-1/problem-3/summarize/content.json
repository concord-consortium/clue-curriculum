(Amber has 6 red chips, which shows how much Tate owes. Amber has 4 black chips, which shows how much Tate earned. If Amber took away pairs of red and black chips, 2 red chips would remain on the board. These 2 red chips show how much Tate still needs to give his sister.) </li><li>What is some other ways Amber can show a total value of -2? (Answers will vary. Possible answer: 11 red chips and 9 black chips)</li><li>What are some ways Amber can show a total value of 0? (Answers will vary. Possible answer: 7 red chips and 7 black chips) </li><li>What are some groups of red chips and black chips that Amber can add to her board that will not change her total value? (Answers will vary. Possible answer: 3 red chips and 3 black chips)</li><li>Note:  You may want to bring out the Associative Property while discussing the Initial Challenge:</li></ul>"
