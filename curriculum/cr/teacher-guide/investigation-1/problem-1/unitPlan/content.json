The problems are deliberately sequenced to simultaneously develop understanding of concepts and skills. </p><p>In Investigation 1, students use the number line to build on their prior understanding of positive rational numbers and to foreshadow operations with negative and positive rational numbers. Problems involving weather build on students’ experiences with positive and negative measures of temperature. Students also use red chips to represent negative quantities and black chips to represent positive quantities to model given situations. </p><p>In Investigation 2, students explore addition and subtraction of rational numbers using chip and number line models. They develop algorithms for addition and subtraction. Students work with different forms of the same information by writing equivalent number sentences (fact families.) This prepares them for future problems in which they will need to reformulate mathematical statements to find solutions to linear equations. </p><p>In Investigation 3, students develop and use algorithms for multiplying and dividing rational numbers. This completes the development of the four basic operations with rational numbers. </p><p>In Investigation 4, the concepts of the Unit come together as students use properties of operations in situations involving rational numbers. In addition to the Commutative Property, additive and multiplicative identities and additive and multiplicative inverses are explored.  Students use the Order of Operations and the Distributive Property to solve problems. The unit ends with a collection of problems in which students must decide what operations they need and then use these operations to find solutions. Knowing which operation to use is more than half way to being able to solve the problem. </p>"

Students experiment with addition and subtraction by modeling real-world situations on chip boards with black and red chips representing positive and negative integers. Students also use the more sophisticated model of a number line. These experiences build the foundation for developing algorithms for addition and subtraction with positive and negative rational numbers. Students will use these operations with whole numbers, fractions, and decimals.</p><p>In Problem 2.1 students use chip board and number line models to make sense of adding integers.  The goal is to engage the students in concrete ways of representing and solving the problems.  Student move from concrete representations to more formal addition algorithms. </p><p>In Problem 2.2 students use the chip boards and number line models to represent and solve problems.  The focus is to develop an algorithm for subtracting integers.  Students also explore the Commutative Property which enhances their understanding of the relationship between addition and subtraction.</p><p>Problem 2.3 supports students in synthesizing their thinking about addition and subtraction with integers.
