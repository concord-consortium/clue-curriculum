            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>This Problem builds on students’ intuitions about negative numbers and asks questions that may be represented by addition or related subtraction expressions. This is a good opportunity for you to learn what your students already know about integers and ways of operating on them. In the 6th grade unit, Points of Rational, students have seen number lines with positive and negative numbers.  Students studied opposites, ordering and absolute value.  </p><p>You do not need to show students standard algorithms for adding or subtracting signed numbers at this time. Students will solve most of the problems using informal arithmetic reasoning. At the end of this Problem, students will be able to recognize the use of and appropriate notation for positive and negative numbers in applied settings. They will also be able to interpret and write mathematical sentences.</p><p><strong>Implementation Note</strong>:  You may want to have a brief conversation after the Initial Challenge to discuss number sentences before having the students work on the What If section. Don’t force formal ways of writing number sentences at this time. (Portrayal)</p><p><strong>Teacher Note</strong>: In Investigation 2, students will develop algorithms for addition and subtraction of integers. To prepare for this collect number sentences that they use in Investigation 1 in digital Learning Logs or on posters like these:</p>"

            "<p><u><strong>Launch (Getting Started)</strong></u></p><p><u>Connecting to Prior Knowledge</u></p><p>Explore extending the number line to include negative integers and rational values. Display <strong>Teaching Aid 1.1:  Number Line- Reviewing </strong><strong><em>Points of Rational</em></strong>.   Discuss the questions on the Teaching Aid.  </p><p>Students should then locate some fractional and decimal values between the integers. Be sure to discuss equivalent fractions and decimals where appropriate. If students are more comfortable with decimals, encourage them to re-write values as fractions. If needed, this is a good time to review estimation and ordering of rational numbers. You can also look for evidence of understanding of these concepts during the Explore. </p><p>Have students draw lines to connect some pairs of numbers to show opposites on their number lines. This helps students become more comfortable with the extended number line. While opposites are discussed in more depth in Problem 1.2, this is a good opportunity to learn what students already know about opposites. </p><p>While absolute value is not explicitly explored in this Problem, some students may connect absolute value, a topic learned in the Grade 6 <em>Points of Rational</em> unit with various aspects of this Problem.</p><p>Show the picture of the <em>Going Positive</em> game board. Ask them to think about what this unit/problem might be about.  </p><p><strong>Implementation Note</strong>:  Using the <em>Going Positive</em> PowerPoint game playing a few questions can help students understand how it is played.  This game can also be used at other times to review ideas. </p>"
