For example, 6 can be made by 1 x 6 and 2 x 3, but it can also be made by -1 x (-6) and -2 x (-3). This version of the game makes you more aware of where the markers are on the board. I needed to carefully check all the possibilities before making my move so that I would have more choices on my next turn or not set up my opponent for a good move.” </li><li>“I tried to get products that would block my opponent.” </li></ul><p>Guide the discussion of strategies to bring out the notion that when using positive and negative products, you have many more combinations to consider than you do when the Product Game is played with nonnegative numbers. </p>"

What would you put your other paper clip on?</p><p><u>Mbato:</u> Since I have a negative number and I am trying to get a negative number; I have to multiply a negative number by a positive number to get a negative number: -2 x 8 = -16 </p><p><u>Teacher</u>: So, you decided that since a negative multiplied by a positive is a negative that you should choose a factor that is positive. So, Mbato used this part of your algorithm for multiplying. [Teacher points to the algorithms that are on a poster displayed in the room that describes this.]</p><p><u>Teacher:</u> Did anyone think about this a different way?</p><p><u>Steven:</u> If my paper clip was on -2 and I wanted to get the product of -16 I saw this as division. I thought of it as -16 ÷ -2 = ∎.  I knew the quotient was going to be positive 8 because a negative number divided by a negative number is a positive number.  </p><p><u>Amber:</u> They are both right because they used equivalent equations from this fact family:</p>"
