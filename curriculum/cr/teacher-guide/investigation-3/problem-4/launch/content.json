            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>The Integer Product Game gives students a fun way to practice multiplication with positive and negative numbers. The board contains positive numbers between 1 and 36 and negative numbers between -1 and -36. Students enjoy the game environment as they carry out multiplication of integers to play the game. The challenge works in two directions. Students have to think about the consequences of choosing a number on the factors list to mark with their paper clip. A player has to consider how the opponent might be able to benefit from the placement of the paper clip and has to think about how to position himself or herself to be able to make a mark on a square. The questions that follow playing the game include situations that are set up to challenge studentsâ€™ thinking about positive and negative integer products.</p>"
