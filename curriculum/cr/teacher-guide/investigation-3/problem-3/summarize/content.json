Have students share their work and explain how they used it.)</li><li>In the Initial Challenge, was Charlie’s claim correct?  (Yes.  When dividing with integers the numeral in the quotient will be the same, the sign will change depending on the signs of the dividend and divisor.)</li><li>In the Initial Challenge, is it possible for Nicole to predict if the fractions will have a terminating or repeating decimal? (The fractions with denominators of 4, 5, 8, 10 would still terminate and the denominators of 3, 6, 7, 9, 11 would repeat.)</li><li>What pattern in Matt find in What If Situation B? (The numerator is the number that is repeating in the repeating decimal)</li></ul><p><strong>Going Further</strong>:  Some students might also enjoy looking at the pattern in the decimals that have a denominator of 11.  </p><ul><li>How did you find the fractional representation for the decimals in What If Situation C?  (Answers will vary.  Focus the discussion on the patterns they found in this problem.  For example: 1.2222… has a repeating pattern of .22222 which was the pattern found in What If Situation C for 2/9 so the equivalent fractional representation would be 1 and 2/9.)</li></ul>"
