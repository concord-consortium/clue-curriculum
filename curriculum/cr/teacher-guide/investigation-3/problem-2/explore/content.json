            "<p><strong>Suggested Questions</strong></p><ul><li>In What If Situation A, what do you notice about the signs of the numbers in each group? (Answers will vary depending on the set they are looking at.)</li><li>Is there a multiplicative identity for multiplication and division of rational numbers? Explain. (1 is the multiplicative identity for multiplication and division of rational numbers. Some examples are 7 x 1 = 7 and 7 รท 1 = 7.) </li><li>Does it matter whether we multiply 1 on the left or right for our multiplicative identity? Why or why not? (No; the Commutative Property of Multiplication allows the multiplicative identity, or any number, to be multiplied on either side.)</li><li>What does it mean for a number to have a multiplicative inverse? (If a number has a multiplicative inverse, then it can be multiplied by some number in order to obtain the multiplicative identity, 1.) </li><li>Is there a multiplicative inverse for each rational number? (Yes, provided that the number is nonzero, the reciprocal of the number is its multiplicative inverse. The product of a number and its multiplicative inverse will always be equal to 1, which is the multiplicative identity. Some examples shown below. Both 1 and -1 are their own multiplicative inverses. Zero has no multiplicative inverse.</li></ul>"
