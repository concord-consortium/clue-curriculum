(We know 3(-4) = -12, so -12  ÷ -4 = 3 and -12 ÷ 3 = -4.) </li><li>How did you decide if the quotient is positive or negative?

            "<p>For What If Situation A, ask students to share their answers and their algorithms for the problems in each of the three groups. Look for opportunities to highlight how multiplication and division are related. Also try to bring out the nature of division problems as sharing or grouping problems when working with rational numbers. (Language)</p><ul><li>Why is the rule “a negative divided by a negative is positive” reasonable? (For example, with -96 ÷(-4) = 24, you can interpret the problem as having a total of -96 and wanting to find out how many groups of -4 you can make by partitioning the total into equal groups. You can make 24 groups of -4 from -96. Also, the quotient must be positive because -4 must be multiplied by a positive 24 to have a product of -96.) </li><li>How can you find the quotient when you divide a negative integer by a positive integer? For example, why does it make sense that -99 ÷11 = -9? (You can think of -99 ÷ 11 =    -9 as sharing a total of -99 into 11 groups of equal size. The groups must be negative amounts, since you are sharing a negative amount, so the quotient must be negative.) </li><li>How can you find the quotient when you divide a positive number by a negative number? (This is difficult to think about. It helps to use fact families and division as the inverse of multiplication. For example, if you want to show 99÷(-11) = -9, you know that -11 x (-9) = 99. Then you know that 99  ÷ (-11) must be -9 and -99 ÷ 11 must equal -9.) </li><li>Compare the algorithms for division of integers and rational numbers. (Possible Answer: The algorithms are the same for both integers and rational numbers. When dividing two numbers with the same sign, the quotient is positive. When dividing two numbers with opposite signs, the quotient is negative.)</li><li>For What If Situation B, how can using fact families be helpful to solve these equations?  (Answers will vary.  Students should be able to relate the given equations to the equivalent equations of Set 1 as 5 ×∎ = -30 or ∎ ×  5 = -30 and Set 2 as 8 ×∎ = -1 or ∎ ×  8 = -1.)</li><li>For What If Situation C, how did you decide if the quotient was positive, negative or zero? (Answers will vary.  Many students will give examples that they have found in this problem to support their answer, push students to use their reasoning about groups, sharing, and/or rates to make sense of the operation of division on two integers a and be where b ≠ 0.)</li></ul>"
