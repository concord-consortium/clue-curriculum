For example, </p><p>Elena described her groups thoughts for Problem 4.1 in the following way.</p><p>We needed to write an expression using four number and the properties of the operations of rational numbers to create the greatest possible value with the four numbers.  We noticed the importance of the Distributive Property and where the parentheses should go in writing an expression we wanted to use. We also used our understanding of the Commutative Property and the Order of Operations.</p><ul><li>What Mathematical Practice(s) did Elenaâ€™s group use to solve this problem?</li><li>What other Mathematical Practices did you use to solve problems in this Investigation?</li><li>In what ways is the mathematics in this Problem connected to prior mathematics?</li></ul>"
