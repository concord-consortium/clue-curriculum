If the signs of the numbers vary, subtract the two numbers and the number with the largest absolute value determines the sign.</li><li>For subtraction, find the distance between the numbers on the number line (how far apart the numbers are). Then, if the minuend is the larger number, the difference is positive and if the minuend is the smaller number, the difference is negative.</li><li>When multiplying or dividing—if the two numbers have the same sign then the product, or quotient, is positive; if the two numbers have different signs the product or quotient is negative. </li></ul><p>Summarizing the relationships between addition and subtraction, multiplication and division. </p><ul><li>Addition and subtraction are opposite operations, inverse operations. Subtraction is the inverse (opposite) of addition and vice versa. Subtraction is the same as adding the opposite value. a – (-b) = a + b. and a -b = a + (-b)</li><li>Multiplication and division are opposite operations, inverse operations.

This means that zero added to a number does not change the value of the number.  -a + 0 = -a n +  0 = n </li><li>One is the multiplicative identity for rational numbers. This means that one multiplied by a number does not change the value of the number.       -p x  1 = -p1 x q = q</li></ul><p><strong>Additive Inverse:</strong></p><ul><li>Any number and its opposite adds to zero.  a +(-a) =0</li></ul><p><strong>Multiplicative Inverses:</strong></p><ul><li>If you multiply a number by its multiplicative inverse (reciprocal), the product is 1.
