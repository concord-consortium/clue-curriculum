            "<p>Water Towers hold supplies of water that get distributed to homes, apartments, and businesses. Clean water is pumped into the tower. It stays in the tower until someone needs to use the water. When someone turns on a faucet, water will leave the tower. The movement of water in and out is called water flow. The average water flow could be positive or negative depending on whether more water is flowing in or out.</p><p>The water tower starts empty.
