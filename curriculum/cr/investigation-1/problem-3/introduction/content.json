            "<p><strong>Problem 1.3</strong></p><p><strong>The Game of Zero: Using a Chip Model </strong></p><p>In the last problem we used a number line to think about representing rational numbers. In this problem, we will explore another way to represent rational numbers. </p><p>Amber’s mother is an accountant. One day Amber hears her mother talking to a client on the phone. During the conversation her mother used the phrases “in the red” and “in the black.”</p><p>Amber asked her mother what these terms mean. Her mother says:</p><p>“When people in business talk about income and expenses, they often use colors to describe the numbers they are dealing with. Black refers to profits (or income) or money you have; red refers to losses (or expenses). A company that is making money, or has money, is ‘in the black’. A company that is losing money is ‘in the red’.”</p><p><em>Note on Notation:</em>  </p><p>Positive numbers are usually written without a sign. For example, +3 = 3 and + 7.5 = 7.5.</p><p>Negative numbers are usually written with a dash like a subtraction sign. For example, –3 and –7.5.</p><p>We use this notation to indicate a negative number. This can be confusing if we don’t read carefully. Parentheses can help. </p><p>-5 – -8 = -5 – –8 = -5 – (–8)</p><p><strong><em>Did You Know? </em></strong></p><p>The color of ink created the sayings “in the black” and “in the red”. When business records were kept on paper, accountants used red ink for expenses and black ink for income. If your income was greater than your expenses, you were “in the black.” If your expenses were greater than your income, you were “in the red.” You wanted to be “in the black”.</p>"
