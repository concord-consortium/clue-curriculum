            "<p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p><p>“Plus−minus (+/−, ±, plus/minus) is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports\">sports</a> statistic used to measure a player&#x27;s impact on the game, represented by the difference between their team&#x27;s total scoring versus their opponent&#x27;s when the player is in the game. In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey\">ice hockey</a>, it measures a player&#x27;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(ice_hockey)\">goal</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_(mathematics)\">differential</a>. When an even-strength goal or shorthanded goal is scored, the plus–minus statistic is increased by one (&quot;plus&quot;) for those players on the ice for the team scoring the goal; the plus–minus statistic is decreased by one (&quot;minus&quot;) for those players on the ice for the team allowing the goal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus%E2%80%93minus#cite_note-1\">[1]</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_play_(sport)\">Power play</a> or penalty shot goals are excluded. An <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_attacker\">empty net</a> does not matter for the calculation of plus–minus. The statistic is sometimes called the <em>plus−minus rating</em>. </p><p>A player&#x27;s plus−minus statistic is calculated for each game played, to provide a more meaningful measure over a full season. The statistic is directly affected by overall team performance, influenced by both the offensive and defensive performance of the team as a whole.” (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus%E2%80%93minus\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus%E2%80%93minus</a>)</p>"
