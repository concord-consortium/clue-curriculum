            "<p>Adding and Subtracting Rational Numbers</p><p>In Investigation 1, we used number lines and chip boards to model addition and subtraction of rational numbers. Now, we will use this information to develop algorithms for adding and subtracting rational numbers. </p><p>An algorithm is a plan, or a series of steps, for doing a computation. In an effective algorithm, the steps lead to a correct answer, no matter what numbers you use. Your class may develop more than one algorithm for each operation. Set a goal to understand and skillfully use at least one algorithm for adding rational numbers and one algorithm for subtracting rational numbers. </p><p>There are two common ways that addition of numbers can be represented. For example, </p><p>Linda has 8 video games, and her friend has 5.  Together they have 8 + 5 = 13 games.</p><p>We can represent this situation on a chip board.</p>"
