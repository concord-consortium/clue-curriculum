            "<p>Possible answer: An algorithm for dividing rational numbers is to divide the absolute values of the two numbers and then decide which sign to use. If the signs are the same, the quotient will be positive. If the signs are different, the quotient will be negative. </p><p>Division by a number is the same operation as multiplication by the number’s multiplicative inverse. So 5/a = 5・(1/a). Because of this, multiplication and division are affected by negative signs in the same way. But multiplication is commutative and division is not.</p>"
