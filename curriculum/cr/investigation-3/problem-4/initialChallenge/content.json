            "<ul><li>What factors would give the least product? The greatest product?</li></ul><p>The least product is given by choosing 6・(-6), since 6・6 will give the greatest absolute value of product, and choosing one negative factor will give a negative product. The greatest product can be found in two ways, either by choosing (-6)・(-6) or by choosing 6・6. These are the factors with the two greatest absolute values, which will give the greatest absolute value of product, and choosing both factors to be positive or both factors to be negative will give a positive product.</p><ul><li>What are three strategies you used to play the game?</li></ul><p>Answers will vary. Here are examples of three strategies students have found:</p><ul><li>“It is better to go second, because if you go first, you really don’t get to make a move on the board.”</li><li>“There are more ways to get certain numbers than there were in the <em>Number Connections.</em> For example in the games from <em>Number Connections</em>, 6 can be made by 1*6 and 2*3, now it can also be made by (-1)*(-6) and (-2)*(-3). This version of the game makes you more aware of where the markers are on the board. I needed to carefully check all the possibilities before making my move so that I would have more choices on my next turn or not set up my opponent for a good move.”</li><li>“I tried to get products that would block my opponent.”</li></ul>"
