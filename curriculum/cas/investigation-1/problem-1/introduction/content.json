This is called the fraction form of a ratio. </p><p><em>How is this fraction form of a ratio the same as or different from fractions?</em></p><p>We also know that two ratios are equivalent if they express the same comparisons. For example, the ratio of green cupcakes to white cupcakes is the same in the following packages: </p><ul><li>2 green cupcakes and 3 white cupcakes</li><li>4 green cupcakes and 6 white cupcakes</li><li>12 green cupcakes and 18 white cupcakes</li></ul><p><em>What patterns do you see among the comparisons?</em></p><p>In this Unit we will learn more about ratios and reasoning with ratios.</p>"
