            "<p>In the <em>Comparing Quantities</em> unit, we looked at many situations that involved ratios. Recall that a ratio is a comparison between two quantities. We looked at many comparison situations such as Packaging Green and White Cupcakes, Walking Backwards Race, and Sharing Smoothie Bars. </p><p>The ratio of green cupcakes to white cupcakes is expressed as:</p><ul><li>For every 2 green cupcakes there are 3 white cupcakes, or</li><li>2 green for every 3 white, or</li><li>2 to 3 or</li><li>2 : 3</li></ul><p>In the <em>Stretching and Shrinking</em> unit, we also wrote the ratio 2 to 3 as â…”. This is called the fraction form of a ratio. </p><p><em>How is this fraction form of a ratio the same as or different from fractions?</em></p><p>We also know that two ratios are equivalent if they express the same comparisons. For example, the ratio of green cupcakes to white cupcakes is the same in the following packages: </p><ul><li>2 green cupcakes and 3 white cupcakes</li><li>4 green cupcakes and 6 white cupcakes</li><li>12 green cupcakes and 18 white cupcakes</li></ul><p><em>What patterns do you see among the comparisons?</em></p><p>In this Unit we will learn more about ratios and reasoning with ratios.</p>"
