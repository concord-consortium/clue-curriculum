In the Grade 6, Comparing Quantities Unit, we explored many ways to compare numbers and to analyze comparisons that involved ratios. We continued our exploration of ratios in the Stretching and Shrinking Unit with similar figures or scale drawings. In this Unit, we will deepen our understanding of proportional relationships, including ways to represent and use comparison strategies for solving problems and making decisions. </p><p>As you work on the problems in this Unit, ask yourself these questions about situations that involve comparisons. </p><ul><li><strong>What</strong> quantities are being compared?</li><li><strong>Why</strong> does the situation involve a proportional relationship (or not)? </li><li><strong>How </strong>might ratios, rates, or percent be used to solve the proportion? </li></ul>"
