This would look very much like “Common Denominator” or “Common Numerator” thinking. (Note: Since these are ratios, there is no denominator or numerator.) <strong>Note: </strong>Since these are ratios, there is no denominator or numerator. This is a strategy of “setting one quantity equal” so you can compare the other quantity.</li><li><strong>Unit Rate.</strong> Students might scale each ratio to have one of the quantities equal to 1. For example, 1 concentrate to x water or x concentrate to 1 water.  <strong>Note:</strong> This is a variation of the strategy of “setting one quantity equal” so you can compare the other quantity. We are just setting one quantity to 1.</li><li><strong>Drawing pictures</strong> to show how much water for each cup of concentrate is in each mix. In this example, the goal is to partition the water so that each cup of concentrate gets the same amount of water. </li></ul>"
