            "<p>In Problem 2.2, students scale ratios to solve problems. The ratios in Problem 2.2 are rates. Each ratio/rate compares two quantities measured in different units, number of pizzas and price in dollars. This is not the first time students have used rates, but it is the first time the word has been explicitly defined. Student also used rate tables in the Grade 6 unit, Comparing Quantities.</p>",

            "<p>While using rate tables to compare pizza prices at two different pizzerias.   The pizza prices foreshadow the introduction of the “constant of proportionality,” which is introduced in Problem 2.3. Students find patterns within a rate table contrasting two different situations, one of which is proportional and the other is not. Students will need to determine the impact of a delivery charge being added to the price of pizzas from one company. Presenting students with a non-proportional situation allows students to compare and contrast to a proportional situation. This makes it more explicit how to describe a proportional relationship.</p>",
