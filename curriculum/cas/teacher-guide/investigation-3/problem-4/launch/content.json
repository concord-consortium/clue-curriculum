            "<p>This Problem provides students with an opportunity to further develop their understanding of proportional relationships. Students will simulate a leaky faucet using a paper cup with a hole in it that is dripping water. If the pressure of the water in the cup remains constant, this relationship would be proportional. Since the experiment is simulating a dripping faucet in which the pressure remains very nearly constant, you may want to suggest that water be added to the dripping cup to keep the height of the water in the cup somewhat constant. In trials, this experiment produced data that permitted students to make convincing predictions.</p>",
