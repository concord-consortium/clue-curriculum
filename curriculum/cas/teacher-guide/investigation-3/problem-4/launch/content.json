            "<p><u><strong>Problem Overview</strong></u></p><p>This problem provides students with an opportunity to further develop their understanding of proportional relationships. Students will simulate a leaky faucet using a paper cup with a hole in it that is dripping water. If the pressure of the water in the cup remains constant, this relationship would be proportional. Since the experiment is simulating a dripping faucet in which the pressure remains very nearly constant, you may want to suggest that water be added to the dripping cup to keep the height of the water in the cup somewhat constant. In trials, this experiment produced data that permitted students to make convincing predictions.</p><p><strong>Implementation Note</strong>: This problem may take two days to complete the experiment, analyze the data, and complete the Problem. You may want to hold a brief summary after the Initial Challenge and have students complete the What If on the second day.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: What If...? Situation B is a review of many of the ideas in this Unit and is a good formative assessment piece for you and the students. (Time)</p>"
