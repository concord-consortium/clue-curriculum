Then you can assess individual understanding based on each student’s written work.</p><p><em>What does it mean to reason proportionally?</em></p><p>(Students should be able to discuss that to compare ratios you must relate the same two quantities in the same order: part to part or part to whole. Students should have begun to understand that proportional reasoning is about making comparisons using multiplicative thinking instead of additive thinking. They should be able to identify strategies for comparing quantities: ratio tables, equivalent ratios, scaling, and percent. Students are beginning to formalize the process of setting up proportions and solving for an unknown value.)</p>"

As you progress through the Unit, students can use the contexts, representations, and connections to express a more solid understanding. By the end of the Unit, students can create a complete picture of understanding.</p><p><strong>Example Strategies for Student Participation</strong></p><p>Teachers use many creative strategies to encourage students’ ownership of their learning. (Agency, Identity, Ownership)</p><p>In this first Investigation, it is important to ask students to reflect on prior learning with questions like:</p><ul><li>How do you recognize a proportional situation?</li><li>What strategies can you use to solve a problem involving proportional reasoning?</li></ul><p>From their experiences in this Unit and in prior Units, students should be using various strategies. In Grade 6 Units, they used rate tables, unit rate, scaling ratios, tape diagrams, double number lines, and pictures. In the Grade 7 Units so far, students have revisited some of those strategies and have added writing proportions to their experiences.</p>"
