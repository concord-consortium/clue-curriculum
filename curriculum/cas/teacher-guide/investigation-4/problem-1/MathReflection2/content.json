Students can pull together their reasoning from the Now What Do You Know? questions to summarize their learning over time. (Time)</p><p>After the class discussion, students can record their responses to the Mathematical Reflection to create a record of their current understandings of the big ideas of the Unit.</p><p>A teacher can gain an understanding of student thinking during a discussion of the reflection question. Then you can assess individual understanding based on each student’s written work.</p><p><em>What does it mean to reason proportionally?</em></p><p>Students should be able to discuss recognizing and analyzing proportional statements.</p><p>Students will have broadened their understanding that proportional reasoning uses multiplicative thinking instead of additive thinking. And proportional reasoning can be used to make decisions and solve problems.</p><p>Notice that:</p><ul><li>Proportional reasoning is about making comparisons: part-to-part and part-to-whole</li><li>Rates are a type of ratio</li><li>Unit rates can be helpful in solving problems</li><li>Unit rates or constant of proportionality can be found in tables, graphs, and equations</li></ul>"

            "<p><strong>Student Responses</strong></p><p>Students may need to work together to outline and summarize the important ideas. They may need examples of writing, diagrams, and/or justifications from other students to help build their vision of what is expected when answering a Mathematical Reflection. Early in the year you may want to start writing Mathematical Reflections as a whole group. Then as the year progresses, move to small groups, pairs, and finally individuals.</p><p>Each Investigation contributes to students’ conceptual understandings of the ideas in the Unit. As you progress through the Unit, students can use the contexts, representations, and connections to express a more solid understanding. This Unit can add to the learning and understandings that students started in Grade 6, especially in the C<em>omparing Quantities</em> Unit.</p><p>After this Investigation, you may want to emphasize students’ discussions:</p><ul><li>How do you recognize a proportional situation?</li><li>What strategies can you use to solve a problem involving proportional reasoning?</li></ul><p><strong>Example Strategies for Student Participation</strong></p><p>You use many creative strategies to encourage students’ ownership of their learning.
