A teacher can gain an understanding of student thinking during a discussion of the reflection question.

They may need examples of writing, diagrams, and/or justifications from other students to help build their vision of what is expected when answering a Mathematical Reflection. Early in the year you may want to start writing Mathematical Reflections as a whole group. Then as the year progresses, move to small groups, pairs, and finally individuals.</p><p>Each Investigation contributes to students’ conceptual understandings of the ideas in the Unit. Students’ explanations at the beginning of a Unit might be just forming. As you progress through the Unit, students can use the contexts, representations, and connections to express a more solid understanding. By the end of the Unit, students can create a complete picture of their understanding.</p><p><strong>Example Strategies for Student Participation</strong></p><p>Here are a few creative strategies teachers use to encourage students’ ownership of their learning.</p>"
