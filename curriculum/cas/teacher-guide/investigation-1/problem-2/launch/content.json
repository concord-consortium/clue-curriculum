(Time) <strong>Teaching Aid 1.2: Ratio Type Notation</strong> may be used to emphasize part to part and part to whole relationships.</p><p>Students were introduced to writing ratios in fraction form in <em>Stretching and Shrinking</em>. This Problem brings the form back, so students have flexibility in the notation used for expressing ratios. It is important for students to begin to differentiate between fractions and ratios written in fraction form. For example, (2c.concentrate)/(3c.water) is not the same as saying 2/3 of the mix is concentrate.  However, (2c.concentrate)/(5c.juice) can be thought of as saying 2/5 of the juice is concentrate. A part to whole situation can be a ratio if we are looking at the relationship between the two quantities – there are 2 cups of concentrate in every 5 cups of juice. It can be a fraction if we are looking at the portion of the juice that is concentrate 2/5  of the juice is concentrate.</p><p>Also, finding equivalence for fractions and ratios can have very different results.</p>"

Fractions are always part to whole relationships of a quantity while ratios can be part to part or part to whole comparisons of two quantities.

When we find equivalent ratios, the amount may change but the relationship between the amounts stays the same.)</li></ul>"
