            "<p><strong>Unit Description </strong></p><p>Many quantitative problems can be solved simply by counting members of a set or by measuring segments, areas, volumes, angles, masses, or temperatures. However, it is often necessary to make decisions that involve comparisons of counts or measurements. The basic step in this way of thinking is developed in elementary grades. During these years, such comparisons are often made by deciding which number is greatest. More useful reasoning often requires more careful comparison—explaining how much greater one number is than another, not in an absolute sense, but in a relative sense.</p><p>When comparing the distance or difference between two numbers, we are using additive thinking such as that developed in <em>Accentuate the Negative </em>and in several of the CMP 6th grade number Units. We can also compare two numbers by asking how many times greater one number is than another. When we do this, we are using multiplicative thinking, much of which was developed in the 6th grade <em>Factoring Structure </em>and <em>Comparing Quantities </em>Units as well as in the 7th grade <em>Accentuate the Negative </em>and <em>Stretching and Shrinking</em> Units. Multiplicative thinking examines how many times greater one number is than another number. Multiplicative thinking also asks what fraction one number is of another number. There are many ways to make comparisons—fractions, ratios, rates, differences, and percents. Building on the reasoning with ratios in 6th grade, one of the fundamental goals of school mathematics, especially middle grades mathematics, is to help students develop flexible understanding, skill, and disposition in using strategies for comparing quantities. This runs throughout the Problems, ACE Exercises, and Mathematical Reflection of <em>Comparing and Scaling. </em>This Unit confronts students with a series of mathematical tasks that encourage them to make decisions about the quantities relevant to each task, how those quantities can be compared most usefully, and what information is provided by various quantitative comparisons. </p><p>The second major theme of this Unit, as the title suggests, is <em>scaling. </em>In its most familiar sense, scaling suggests making something larger or smaller, but similar in key respect to an original. Ratios and fractions often express comparative information in scaled-down form. For example, if a class consists of 15 boys and 10 girls, we might say that the ratio of boys to girls is 3 to 2 or that 3 out of 5 students in the class are boys. We could also say that 60% of the class is boys, a kind of scaling up, from 3:5 to 60:100.</p><p><em>Comparing Quantities</em> lays the foundation for supporting scaling with quantities. <em>Stretching and Shrinking </em>lays a solid of visual imagery to support the basic notion of scaling. The idea of ratio comparison was introduced in these two Units, along with informal ideas of equivalent ratios. These ideas are extended in the current Unit. In addition, <em>rate </em>is defined as a special type of ratio that compares two measurements with different units. </p><p>In <em>Stretching and Shrinking</em>, the goal was to find dimensions of a larger (or smaller) physical or graphical model of some situation while preserving the relative size of the component parts so that the figures remained mathematically similar. The same ideas and ways of thinking developed in <em>Stretching and Shrinking</em> become powerful ways of thinking about ratios in <em>Comparing and Scaling</em>. The goal is the same in many ratio situations—to scale the ratios up or down to determine whether they are the same or different.</p><p>Another way the more numerical situations in <em>Comparing and Scaling </em>relate to the more geometric ideas in <em>Stretching and Shrinking</em> is that comparison problems often call for finding the missing part of a ratio equivalent to a given ratio, which is the same as solving a proportion. For example, suppose you have a rectangle with dimensions of 5 cm by 7 cm. You want to draw a larger, similar rectangle with the dimension corresponding to 5 cm being 15 cm. What would the other dimension be? This is the same as the question: If roses are 5 for $7 and I want to buy 15 roses, how much will they cost? In each case, we are dealing with the given ratio of 5 to 7 and looking for the equivalent ratio of 15 to x. <em>Stretching and Shrinking </em>precedes <em>Comparing and Scaling</em> to give students prior experience with these ideas in a more concrete geometric context.</p><p>To summarize, the broad purposes of this Unit are to deepen students’ ability to make intelligent comparisons of quantitative information—using ratios, fractions, decimals, rates, unit rates, and percents—and to use quantitative comparison information to make larger or smaller scale models of given situations or to scale rates and ratios up and down as needed. An additional goal of this Unit is to have students not only learn different ways to reason in proportional situations, but also recognize when such reasoning is appropriate.</p><p>Many important mathematical applications involve comparing quantities of one kind or another. In some cases, the problem is simply deciding which of two quantities is greater and describing how much greater it is. In such instances, we subtract to find a difference. This is what students deal with in elementary school. In fact, since situations that call for comparison by addition or subtraction come first in students’ experiences with mathematics, for many students this way of thinking becomes inappropriately pervasive in any situation requiring comparison. </p>"

In Problem 1.1 a context of various orange juice recipes raises the important question of how you decide whether to use a difference, ratio, fraction, or percent to make a particular comparison. In Problem 1.2 students use a variety of strategies for making comparisons and identify how information in each of these forms provides the information needed to derive any of the other forms. In Problem 1.3 students build on their prior understandings of proportional relationships to recognize and represent proportional relationships in new situations.

There are many different ways to make comparisons. In this Investigation, students isolate ratios and rates as being useful comparisons for a variety of situations. The situations in this Investigation motivate students to find and use unit rates. They then compare unit rates within a problem to decide which option is best. Unit rate and the constant of proportionality are recognized in contextual situations, tables, graphs, and equations, and are used to solve problems. Students can use other strategies to solve problems as well, such as rate tables, equations, and graphs. In Problem 2.1 students encounter deciding which table to sit at when the number of seats and amount of pizza are different at each table. Students use ratios to make their decision. In Problem 2.2 students investigate rates and rate tables using the price of pizza at different restaurants. In Problem 2.3 students look at unit rates and the constant of proportionality in several contexts on purchasing items.</p>"

Ratios, equivalent ratios, and unit rates were introduced in 6th grade in<em> Comparing Quantities</em>, and reinforced in other 6th grade Units, <em>Let’s Be Rational 1</em> and <em>2</em> and <em>Data About Us</em>. In 7th grade <em>Stretching and Shrinking</em> investigates what proportional reasoning means in geometric situations, and the ideas of scaling and scale factor are introduced in terms of scaling up or down a geometric figure. In <em>Comparing and Scaling</em>, unit rate is prominent, and students learn how unit rate is integral to the tables, graphs, and equations representing proportional relationships. Students are encouraged to look for similarities across multiple contexts, and to recognize proportional situations in any representation. Proportions* are solved using various strategies, reflecting students’ familiarity with ratios and rate tables. Non-proportional situations are introduced to strengthen students’ sense of a proportional relationship.</p><p></p><p>LINK TO THE FUTURE: Later in 7th grade the Unit <em>Moving Straight Ahead </em>explores linear relationships. Some of these linear relationships are proportions and some are not. The contrast will be made. In addition, in 8th grade inverse variation will be contrasted with proportions.</p><p>In roughly this order, students: </p><ul><li>Analyze when a situation is proportional and when it is not,</li><li>Represent proportional relationships, using tables, graphs, and equations,</li><li>Recognize when a table, graph or equation represents a proportional situation,</li><li>Relate unit rate in proportional situations to constant of proportionality on a graph, to the coefficient of x in the form y = mx, or to the ratio y/x = m/1,</li><li>Connect percent relationships to proportional reasoning,</li><li>Solve problems (throughout the Unit) in various contexts, including discounts and markups, using various strategies, including scaling, graphing, unit rates, and proportions.</li></ul><p>*Note: Teachers may recall solving proportions by &quot;cross- multiplying.&quot; CMP does not recommend that you teach this.

            "<p><strong>Unit Arc of Learning</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Unit is to develop students’ abilities to make intelligent comparisons of quantitative information – using ratios, fractions, decimals, rates, unit rates, and percents – and to use quantitative information to scale rates and ratios up and down as needed. Students not only learn different ways to reason in proportional situations, but also to recognize when such reasoning is appropriate. Developing proportional reasoning starts with the 6th grade <em>Comparing Quantities</em> Unit and surfaces throughout the rest of the 6th grade Units. Thoroughly understanding and skillfully using proportional reasoning means that students need to explore it in many different contexts, recognizing when it is appropriate and when it is not. In 7th grade proportional reasoning is the backbone of most of the Units. For example, similar figures or scale drawings provide a geometric context for exploring proportional reasoning in the <em>Stretching and Shrinking</em> Unit. It surfaces in the <em>Moving Straight Ahead </em>Unit as students explore linear situations, some of which are proportional, and some of which are not. It is also the backbone for the <em>How Likely Is It?</em> Unit to explore probability situations. It surfaces again in the <em>Filling and Wrapping</em> and <em>Samples and Population</em> Units. Proportional reasoning by definition is done within the context of other mathematical strands: geometry, number, probability, data, and functions.</p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ii7VMslhsJSOZv8zbFjF-N3lMALVS6aD/view?usp=sharing\">Click here to view <em>Comparing and Scaling</em> Unit Arc of Learning</a></p>"
