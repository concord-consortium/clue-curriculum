            "<p>Students encounter an open-ended situation in which they need to make a decision using a comparison. In this Problem, students are challenged to compare drink recipes. They use proportional reasoning to figure out which recipe will create the most “orangey” tasting juice. Posing the Problem in an open way allows students to find many different ways to think about the situation. Students have experience with ratios and unit rates from the sixth grade Comparing Quantities Unit. This Problem gives you an opportunity to see what students recall from that Unit and how they will apply it in a new situation. A discussion about ratios and strategies for comparing ratios is effective after students have their own ideas about the Problem.</p><p><strong>Implementation Note</strong>: Be sure to hold a discussion after the Initial Challenge before moving on to the What If. This will allow you to highlight your students’ strategies before analyzing the strategies of other students. You can use the strategies presented in the What If to connect to how your students thought about the proportional reasoning in the juice recipes. This Problem will take two days.</p>"
