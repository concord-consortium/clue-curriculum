In Problems 1.1 and 1.2, students used a variety of strategies to scale ratios while solving contextual problems. In Problem 1.3, students formalize what they learned by setting up proportions and using the scaling up or scaling down strategy to find unknown values.</p><p>Introduce the vocabulary of proportions and proportional reasoning.  Revisit Adia’s and Otis’s strategies to introduce the terms from Problem 1.2. Note that students have been solving proportions since the third Unit of Grade 6: <em>Comparing Quantities.</em> And students were solving proportions when they were finding missing side lengths on scale drawings in Stretching and Shrinking. Ask students for examples of finding a missing quantity from their prior Units. <strong>Teaching Aid 1.3 Proportional Reasoning Examples</strong> can be used to show a couple of examples from prior Units.</p><p>It is important that students understand that when setting up a proportion, the ratios are relating the same two quantities. Labeling the quantities will help students make sure that they are comparing.</p>"
