Students do not need to memorize an extensive list of stakeholders, but instead will explore the (sometimes aligned, sometimes competing) wants and needs of key stakeholders in their community through stakeholder mapping. Students will also re-examine and challenge the current need statement, making changes if necessary to best express the shared need of a diverse group of stakeholders. Students will use this knowledge to propose and evaluate design solutions that would meet stakeholder need in the following lessons. </p>"
