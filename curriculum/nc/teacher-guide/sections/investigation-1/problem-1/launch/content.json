            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>This problem provides students with an opportunity to review and enhance their understanding of factors by playing the <em>Factor Game </em>. While playing the game, students become familiar with the factors (or divisors) of the numbers from 2 to 30. They also review multiplication and division of small whole numbers. Students analyze winning strategies that depend on recognizing which numbers have an abundance of factors and multiples by evaluating equations using this knowledge. </p><p><strong>Implementation Notes: </strong>This problem may take two days. Giving students time to analyze the <em>Factor Game</em> board moves and then generalize the patterns will help students build a solid foundation for this unit and connect to the ideas on algebraic expressions and equations that were started in the unit <em>Variables and Patterns</em>.</p><p>In What If...? Situation B, there are four patterns. described that students are to decide if they are correct. Differentiate the patterns in the classroom by assigning two patterns to each group. Discuss all of them in the summary. (Agency, Identity, Ownership) </p><p><strong>Project: </strong>The <em>My Favorite Number</em> idea described in the introduction could be completed by students as a miniproject throughout the unit. Each problem could add a new idea about their number similar to Isabella&#x27;s in the Student Edition. </p>"

            "<p><strong>Presenting the Challenge</strong></p><p>Introduce the <em>Factor Game</em>. The rules for the game are given in the Student Edition, but the best way to get students started is ti play a game against the class. Display a <em>Factor Game</em> board using <strong>Teaching Aid 1.1: </strong><strong><em>Factor Game</em></strong><strong> Board</strong>. Explain the rules as the need arises during the game. When you play against the class, take the first turn. Choose a nonprime number, such as 26, for your first move. This way. students can discover the power of a prime first move during their Explore time.</p><p>Your sample game against the class might begin like this: </p><ul><li>Place a transparent colored chip on the number 26.</li><li>Ask the class which numbers they should place their colored chips on (1, 2, and 13).</li><li>Record your score of 26 points.</li><li>Ask the class how many points they score (1 + 2 + 13 = 16).</li><li>Ask the class to choose a number.</li><li>Suppose they choose 22.</li><li>Ask which numbers you get to put chips on (only 11, since 1 and 21 are already covered by a chip). Record the points (22 for the students, 11 for you).</li></ul><p>Continue playing until students understand the rules. You do not need to finish the game. Avoid the temptation to point out strategies during the practice game. Focus on understanding the rules and scoring. Allow students to discover strategies on their own during the Explore. (Time) Have students play the <em>Factor Game</em> with a partner several times using <strong>Learning Aid 1.1A: </strong><strong><em>Factor Game</em></strong><strong> Boards</strong> and <strong>Learning Aid 1.1B: </strong><strong><em>Factor Game </em></strong><strong>Recording First Moves</strong>. Then have students continue with their partner working on the What If...? situations. Assign tow patterns from What If...? Situation B to each partner group.</p>"
