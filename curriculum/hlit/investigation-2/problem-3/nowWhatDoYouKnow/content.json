            "<p>To find experimental probability with a spinner, you would have to spin the spinner. Using the results of the trials to write the probability of desired outcome to total trials, you can predict future outcomes. The more trials you have, the more reliable your probability.</p><p></p><p>To find theoretical probability with a spinner, you have to analyze the spinner. You would have to determine the portion of the angle measure to determine how likely a result might be. For example, if the spinner is a circle that is equally divided into four parts, each part would have a 90˚ out of 360˚ or a 1 in 4 chance. If there is more than one spinner, you would have to make an organized list or tree diagram of the portions on each spinner.</p><p></p><p>Finding the probabilities using spinners is like what we did in Investigations 1 and 2. The difference is that you need to analyze the portions of the spinner.</p>"
