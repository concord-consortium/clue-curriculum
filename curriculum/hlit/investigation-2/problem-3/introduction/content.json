            "<p><strong>Designing a Spinner to Find Probabilities</strong></p><p>In the last Problem, we looked at a bonus prize for the winners of the <em>Gee Whiz Everyone Wins!</em> game. To win the bonus prize each winner drew a block from each of two bags. Each outcome consisted of two events: drawing a block from one bag, then drawing a block from a second bag. This bonus game consisted of two events, which can also be called a <strong>compound event</strong>. </p><p>To find all the outcomes, some students made <em>organized</em> lists like Tevy’s. </p><p>Some students used a diagram like Santo’s, called a <em>tree diagram</em>, which is a diagram that uses branches to show the sample space of an event.</p><p>In this Problem we will look at a game involving spinners. We will look at both compound and non-compound events.</p><p>Spring vacation has arrived! Kaleb thinks he can stay up until 11:00 p.m. every night. His grandparent thinks Kaleb will have more energy for his activities during the vacation if he goes to bed at 9:00 p.m. Kaleb makes the three spinners shown below. He is negotiating with his grandparent to use one of the spinners to determine his bedtime. </p>"
