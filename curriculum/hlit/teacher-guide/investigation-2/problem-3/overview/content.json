          "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>In this Problem, students investigate a spinner that Kaleb might use to determine his bedtime. Students confront some possible misconceptions about the relationship between angle measure and probability situations involving spinners. </p><p></p><p>Mathematical Note: The spinners in this Problem are circles with the spinning mechanism in the center of the circle. Because of the shape, the ratio of the angle measures and/or the ratio of the areas of a sections can be used to determine the theoretical probability. Students may accurately use either area or angle measure.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, on a spinner like the one below, the spinning mechanism is not in the center of the circle. </p>"
