            "<p><u>Making the Mathematics Explicit </u></p><p><strong>Suggested questions</strong></p><ul><li>In the Initial Challenge the spinner has three 9:00 options, two 10:00 options and one 11:00 option.  Does this mean that 9:00 is most likely to occur? (No.  The fraction of the total angle of each section of the spinner is what you need to consider with a spinner.)</li><li>How did you determine the theoretical probabilities for 9:00, 10:00 and 11:00?  (Answers will vary.  Bring out the size of the pieces and that each of the 9:00 and 10:00 pieces is 1/8 of the circle and that the 11:00 piece is 3/8 of the circle.)</li><li>How did you determine the amount of times out of 64 spins that it would land on 9:00, 10:00 and 11:00?  (Answers will vary.  Bring out the use of proportions and scaling up.)</li><li>What do Kaleb’s grandparents have to consider when designing a spinner if they want Kaleb to go to bed at 9:00? (Size of the total angle of the sections for 9:00 need to be more than any other time frame.  Have students show this using the spinners they designed in the Initial Challenge)</li><li>In the What If, will a tree diagram and an organized list work for the lunch menu spinners?  (Yes.  Have students share examples.)</li><li>How did you determine the probability of Kaleb getting his favorite lunch of pizza, corn, and milk?  (Answers will vary.  Look for students making sense of all the possible outcomes.)</li><li>How is a spinner similar or different than using coins, cups, or number cubes?  (Answers will vary.  Lead students to discussing the fraction of the total angle for each section of the spinner). </li></ul>"
