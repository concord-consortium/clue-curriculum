(The 9:00 and 10:00 sections are each 45 degrees (half of 90 degrees. The 11:00 section is 135 degrees.)</li><li>How much of the total area of the circle is each bedtime option? (11:00 is 3/8 of the circle; 9:00 is 3/8 of the circle and 10:00 is 2/8 of the circle.)</li><li>Would it help to collect some experimental data for What If Situation A? (Answers will vary.  The use of three spinners with different size sections may require some experimenting before students are comfortable looking at them theoretically.)</li></ul>"
