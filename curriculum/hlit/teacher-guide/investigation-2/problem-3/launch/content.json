For number cubes, one technique is to shake the number cubes in your hand, and roll them so they hit a wall and bounce back. Another is to put the number cubes in a container, shake it, and then dump them out. With spinners, achieving randomness requires using a strong flick of the finger to put the pointer in motion. Electronic spinners would be useful. Discuss with students the need to make sure that the way they conduct the experiment will not affect, or bias, the outcome.</p>"

Many students believe that whether or not the sections of a spinner are adjacent will affect their probabilities. In other words, students may mistakenly disregard the fraction of the total angle each section of the spinner occupies. They may instead focus on the number of sections. In this case, students may struggle to see that 11:00 has the same probability on each spinner.</p><p></p><p>Explain to students that Kaleb decided to make his own spinner for determining his bedtime. Demonstrate a few spins on <strong>Teaching Aid 2.3: Bedtime Spinner</strong>. Place the point of a sharpened pencil or a pen through the circular end of a paper clip and onto the center of the spinner or overlay it with a plastic blank spinner.  Flick the spinner with your finger. Record each result and demonstrate how to keep a tally for each spin. After spinning two or three times, ask whether you have a large enough sample. Students should realize that a few spins do not generate enough data to predict the behavior of the spinner over the long run. (If needed you could conduct the experiment multiple times and look at some experimental probability as a whole class.  One person spins and one records the results for all to see.)</p><p></p><p>Have copies of <strong>Teaching Aid 2.3:  Bedtime Spinner</strong> available in case students want to try a few experimental spins as they are working on the Initial Challenge.
