(No. Tevy has a better chance to win. P(not three coins matching)=6*(1/8)=6/8=3/4)</li><li>Santo does not have a good chance to win. P(three coins matching)=2*(1/8)=2/8=1/4)</li><li>How can you make the game fair? (You can change the point values. Give Santo 3 points for each triple match and Tevy one point for each double match. Then six points would be needed to win a game. You can also change the way to earn points. Santo gets a point if there are at least two heads and Tevy gets a point if there are at least two tails. Play the game to see who gets the most points.)</li></ul><p></p><p>You can use the outcomes to ask other questions about this experiment:</p><p></p><ul><li>What is the probability of getting zero heads? (1/8)</li><li>What is the probability of getting exactly one head?  (3/8)</li><li>What is the probability of getting exactly two heads? (3/8)</li><li>What is the probability of getting three heads? (1/8)</li><li>What is the probability of getting two heads and one tail?  (3/8)</li><li>What is the probability of no coins matching? (0/8)</li><li>What is the probability of getting at least one head?  (7/8)</li><li>Compare an organized list to a tree diagram. (They are similar. A tree diagram is an organized list and may work better for larger numbers. Both have the same sample space.)</li><li>How did you determine the theoretical probabilities in What If Situation A? (Answers will vary. Some will draw a tree diagram and others will just make a list.  Have groups share their thinking.)</li><li>Compare the theoretical probabilities to the experimental probabilities in the What If. (Answers will vary.)</li><li> What are the outcomes for which Akimi will win in What If Situation C? Brelynn? (Akimi wins for Red from the first bag and Red from the second bag. Brelynn wins for Red from first bag and Blue from the second bag, and also for Blue from the first bag and Red from the second bag.)</li><li>If Brelynn and Akimi play the game 18 times, how many times does each person expect to win? (Brelynn would be 4/18 and Akimi would be 2/18)</li></ul><p></p><p>Going further:  Have students analyze how many outcomes would be in the sample space if you have four coins. </p>"
