          "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>In this Problem, students are challenged about their beliefs about the differences between possible and probable and between fair and unfair games. Many students believe that possible and probable mean the same thing and that a game of chance is fair if each player has a chance to win, even if all players are not equally likely to win. This Problem directly challenges those beliefs.</p><p></p><p>Students analyze a coin-tossing game and discover that the game is not a fair game of chance. This Problem also introduces a special kind of organized list, the tree diagram. Students learn how to create and use a tree diagram to find all possible outcomes of an action, and then to use the results to determine theoretical probabilities of another game of chance.</p>"
