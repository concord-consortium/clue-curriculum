          "<p><u><strong>Launch (Getting Started)	</strong></u><u>				</u></p><p><u>Connecting to Prior Knowledge</u></p><p>The coin tossing game is a two-person game, so students need to think in terms of two players. In fair games of chance, each player has the same chance, or probability, of winning. If your students need more time with experimental probability you may want to collect experimental data as a whole class. The class wins if all three coins match and you win for any other result. Play the game 30 times. If you do this, record the outcomes of the experiment so that students can see them. (Agency, Identity, Ownership)</p><p></p><p>In the What If Situations students will analyze the idea of using an organized list and a tree diagram for finding all the possible outcomes and the theoretical probability.  </p>"
