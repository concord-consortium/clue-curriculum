            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>In this Problem, students are challenged about their beliefs about the differences between possible and probable and between fair and unfair games. Many students believe that possible and probable mean the same thing and that a game of chance is fair if each player has a chance to win, even if all players are not equally likely to win. This Problem directly challenges those beliefs. </p><p>Students analyze a coin-tossing game and discover that the game is not a fair game of chance. This Problem also introduces a special kind of organized list, the tree diagram. Students learn how to create and use a tree diagram to find all possible outcomes of an action, and then to use the results to determine theoretical probabilities of another game of chance.</p>"

            "<p><strong>Launch (Getting Started)</strong></p><p><u>Connecting to Prior Knowledge</u></p><p>The coin tossing game is a two-person game, so students need to think in terms of two players. In fair games of chance, each player has the same chance, or probability, of winning. If your students need more time with experimental probability you may want to collect experimental data as a whole class. The class wins if all three coins match and you win for any other result. Play the game 30 times. If you do this, record the outcomes of the experiment so that students can see them. (Agency, Identity, Ownership)</p><p>In the What If Situations students will analyze the idea of using an organized list and a tree diagram for finding all the possible outcomes and the theoretical probability.  </p>"
