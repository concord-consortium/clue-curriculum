            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>The Introduction for Investigation 2 introduces the vocabulary word, <em>theoretical probability</em>. It uses flipping a coin as the example to understand the term. (You might have some fun with kids- a thin imperceptible layer of superglue on a penny will make it not fair. Test four coins. Find out which one is not fair.) </p><p>Theoretical probabilities are similar to experimental probabilities. But to determine the number of outcomes for experimental probabilities, like heads occurring, we conduct an experiment. The outcomes for theoretical probabilities are determined by examining the possible outcomes. Then we analyze and count the number of favorable and non-favorable events. For example, if a coin is tossed, there are two outcomes – a head or tail occurs. Each has the same chance of occurring on any toss of the coin. </p><p>As we conduct more and more trials the experimental probability will get closer to the theoretical probability or ½ in the case of tossing a fair coin.</p><p>In Problem 2.1, students choose colored blocks from a bag or bucket to determine experimental probabilities. They find the theoretical probabilities by counting the number of each color and then finding the fraction of blocks of a certain color in the container. Then, students contrast the theoretical probabilities with experimental probabilities.</p><p><strong>Implementation Note</strong>: This Problem will take two days. The first day do the Initial Challenge as a whole class and then on day 2 have students work with a partner on the What If Situations.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The answers for Problem 2.1 are based on a bucket containing 9 red blocks, 6 yellow blocks, and 3 blue blocks. You may, of course, change the contents of the bucket, but this will change the answers.</p>"
