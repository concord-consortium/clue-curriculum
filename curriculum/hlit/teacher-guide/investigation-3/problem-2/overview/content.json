          "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>In this Problem, students play and analyze a game called Roller Derby. To play the game, each team places 12 markers in any way they choose on a game board with columns numbered from 1 to 12. The teams then take turns rolling two number cubes and removing a marker from the column corresponding to the sum of the cubes. The first team to remove all its markers wins. After playing the game, students list all the possible outcomes (number pairs) and use the list to devise strategies for winning the game.</p><p></p><p><strong>Implementation Note</strong>:  Having students design their own game in What If Situation B will take two days.  However, this time is valuable for students to synthesize their understanding about theoretical probability in this new setting and time for the teacher to gather formative assessment on the studentsâ€™ understanding of these ideas.
