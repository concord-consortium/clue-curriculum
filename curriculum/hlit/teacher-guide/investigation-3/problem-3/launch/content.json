            "<p><u>Presenting the Challenge</u></p><p>Collect various simulation suggestions. Analyze these suggestions with the class briefly. There should be exactly one matching pair among five choices.  For example, If students suggest using spinners, help them to see that in order to simulate the situation, the part the spinner lands on for the first spin can no longer be available on the second spin. They could use a five-part spinner (win, win, lose, lose, lose) for the first spin and a four-part spinner (win, lose, lose, lose) for the second spin. Students would only need the second spinner if the first spinner gives a win. Students have to record the outcome as lose every time the first spinner comes up lose without going to the second spinner. Students would also have to record lose every time the first spinner comes up win and the second spinner does not.</p><p>Let the class explore the Problem in groups of two to four students. (The way you arrange it depends on whether you do the same simulation as a class or if students all do different simulations.)</p>"
