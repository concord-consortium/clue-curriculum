          "<p><strong>Explore (Digging In)	</strong></p><p><u>Providing for Individual Needs</u></p><p>Each group must decide for itself how to collect the data and when they have collected enough data to find a reasonable experimental probability. Be sure that each method is mathematically equivalent to the scratch-off prize card. If the class does different simulations, display the posters around the room and give the class time to examine and comment on them. (Agency, Identity, Ownership) (Portrayal)</p><p></p><p>Allow the groups to plan and carry out their simulations, collect their data, and find the experimental probability. When they have completed their experiment, students should move onto finding theoretical probabilities and the What If. </p><p></p><p><strong>Examples</strong>:  One way to simulate the game is to put two red blocks, one white block, one yellow block, and one blue block in an opaque container. Then choose two blocks at a time. When you choose the two red blocks, you simulate scratching off the two matching spots. Another possibility is to have five students act as the “spots.” They hold tags that are hidden from the rest of the class. Two students hold tags with matching symbols, and three hold tags with three other symbols. A seated student chooses two of the five students to reveal their tags. After each guess, students mix up their tags. </p>"
