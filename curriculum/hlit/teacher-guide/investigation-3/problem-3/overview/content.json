          "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>In this Problem, students analyze a toy storeâ€™s scratch-off prize card contest. They find the probability of winning a prize first by experimenting with the game and then by analyzing the possible outcomes. For the first time, students are asked to devise a simulation to find experimental probabilities. They have experimented with spinners, blocks, and number cubes before, but in this Problem, they need to decide how to use these objects.</p><p></p><p><strong>Implementation Note:</strong> What If Situation C can be optional, used as homework, or as a project.
