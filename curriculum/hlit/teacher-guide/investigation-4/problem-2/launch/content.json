            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>In this Problem, students investigate two-stage outcomes in the context of a one- and-one free-throw situation. A player with a 60% free throw percentage goes for a one-and-one. That is, the player attempts the first free throw and then either takes a second free throw (if the first one was made) or does not get a second chance (if the first free throw was missed).</p><p>After determining experimental probabilities that the player will get a score of 0, 1, or 2, students find the theoretical probability by using an area model.</p><p><strong>Implementation Note:</strong>  Have a brief discussion after What If Situation A then launch students into What If Situation B.</p>"
