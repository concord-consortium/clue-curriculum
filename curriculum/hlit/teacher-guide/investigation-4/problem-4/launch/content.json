            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>Students are introduced to binomial situations. Students use lists or tree diagrams to determine outcomes. The situations lead naturally to Pascalâ€™s Triangle, which is explored in ACE. Students use lists or tree diagrams to determine binomial probabilities in situations, such as taking a true/false test, programming robots to turn right or left on command; or the winning of a baseball series between two evenly matched teams. Students recognize that once they have analyzed one binomial situation, they can use this knowledge to answer questions about different binomial situations.</p><p><strong>Implementation Note</strong>: This Problem can be seen as a mini project. There are three binomial situations given. Assign one to a group of three to four students. Experiment 4 is not a binomial situation. This can be used in your classroom for groups needing more practice with finding theoretical probabilities in general or for a group to do a second one to use a contrast with the binomial situations.</p>"
