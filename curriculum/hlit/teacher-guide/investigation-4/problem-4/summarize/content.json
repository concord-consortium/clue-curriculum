            "<p><u>Making the Mathematics Explicit</u> </p><p><strong>Suggested Questions</strong></p><ul><li>What do you notice/wonder about the three experiments in the Initial Challenge? (Answers will vary. Noticing that they each have 32 outcomes is important.)</li><li>How are the three experiments in this Problem the same? Different? How does knowing about one of the experiments help you to solve similar ones? (They are all binomial situations. They all involve the binomial situation happening five times for a total of 32 outcomes. The types of outcomes were different. Knowing that there would be 32 outcomes for a binomial event happening 5 times helped to find the probabilities for other situations with this setting.)</li><li>Why did each of the three experiments have the same number of outcomes? (There are two possible outcomes for each stage in each of the situations, and they are both equally likely events. Also, the probability of each outcome is the same for a one-stage event for example: P(H) = P(T) = P(G) = P(B) = 50%. You can use tree diagrams to count the number of possible outcomes for a multistage event, and the number of outcomes doubles for every stage added. So, the number of outcomes for a five-question true/false quiz is the same as the number of outcomes for a five-game baseball series.)</li><li>What if there were six questions for the true/false quiz, six moves for the robots, six games in the baseball series; how many outcomes would there be? (26 or 64)</li></ul><p>If a group did Experiment 4 have them share their results. </p><ul><li>How is Experiment 4 similar to/different from the other three experiments? (Although the final outcome that Kaleb is looking for is even or odd each time he draws a block there are three options for an odd number and 2 options for an even number.)</li></ul><p></p>"
