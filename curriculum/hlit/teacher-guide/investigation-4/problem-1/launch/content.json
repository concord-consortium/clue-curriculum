            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>Students are introduced to an area model for analyzing probabilities with two-stage outcomes. </p><p>An area model is used to analyze the theoretical probability for two-stage probability situations. Students could use a tree diagram to solve this Problem as well. The purpose of this Problem is to introduce the area model for probabilities in a simple two-stage situation, however. Furthermore, this Problem is meant to prepare students for how an area model can be used in a more complex two-stage situation later in Problem 4.2 (one-and-one free throws in basketball).</p><p>Note: One other context option for compound events is the weather. For example, looking at the chance of rain and the temperature. Or looking at the wind and sunny/cloudy forecast. You might want to have a discussion presenting percentages for each and discussing if they are equally likely. </p>"
