            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>Students are introduced to an area model for analyzing probabilities with two-stage outcomes. </p><p>An area model is used to analyze the theoretical probability for two-stage probability situations. Students could use a tree diagram to solve this Problem as well. The purpose of this Problem is to introduce the area model for probabilities in a simple two-stage situation, however. Furthermore, this Problem is meant to prepare students for how an area model can be used in a more complex two-stage situation later in Problem 4.2 (one-and-one free throws in basketball).</p><p>Note: One other context option for compound events is the weather. For example, looking at the chance of rain and the temperature. Or looking at the wind and sunny/cloudy forecast. You might want to have a discussion presenting percentages for each and discussing if they are equally likely. </p>"

            "<p><strong>Mathematics Note:</strong> The connection between fractions and ratios is complex. </p><p>You can write a ratio in fraction notation. For example, you might have 1 green marble for every 2 white marbles. This can be written 1:2, which can be written ½ . ½ as a fraction means 1 part out of two totals in the whole, whereas this ½ as a ratio does not imply anything about total. It is a part-to-part ratio. </p><p>Another difference between fractions and ratios is putting together amounts. When adding fractions, we get equal size pieces in the whole (denominator) and add the number of pieces (numerators). For example, 1/2 + 1/2 = 2/2. If we combine two ratios, we can add to both the quantities. For example, if we have a box of 1 green for every 2 white and another box of 1 green for every 2 white, we get 2 green for every 4 white. Or, 1/2 and 1/2 as a ratio could mean 2/4. Many times, we combine ratios to find equivalent ratios.</p><p>Students often do not understand all of the subtleties between fractions and ratios. For this reason, when you write ratios in fraction form, it is helpful for students to label the two quantities from the ratio. For example,</p><p>10 cm tall/8 cm wide   =   5 cm tall/4 cm wide</p>"
