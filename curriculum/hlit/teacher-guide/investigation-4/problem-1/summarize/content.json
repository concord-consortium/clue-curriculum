            "<p><u>Making the Mathematics Explicit </u></p><p><strong>Suggested questions</strong></p><ul><li>For spinner A, what are the probabilities of getting each color? (1/6 for blue, yellow, and green and 3/6 for red)</li><li>How did you represent this on the area model? (Divide one side of the square in proportion to the probabilities for each color on spinner A. Use these divisions to divide the square to represent the first of the two events.)</li><li>For spinner B, what are the probabilities of getting each color? (1/3)</li><li>How did you represent this on the area model? (Subdivide the square into three equal partson the other side of the square.)</li><li>How many regions do you have? (18)</li><li>What does each region represent? (The results of two spins)</li><li>Which regions represent purple? (Those labeled RB or BR)</li><li>What is the probability of getting purple? (4/18, or 2/9)</li><li>What are some other probabilities for this game? (Possible response: 1/6 for RR, 1/18 for GG or BB.)</li><li>How did you determine the theoretical probability for Making Purple? (Answers will vary. Some students may use a list, some may use a tree diagram, some may use an area model. Bring out all of these strategies and how they are related.)</li><li>Is Making Purple a fair game? (No. Have students prove this through theoretical probabilities and/or their work in What If Situation B.)</li><li>What are all the possible outcomes of drawing a marble from Bucket 1 and then Bucket 2? (Students may start by making a list or tree diagram. That is fine. Lead them to thinking about it as an area model.)</li><li>How many regions/sections are there? (12)</li><li>What does each region/section represent? (The result of drawing a marble from each bucket to get two marbles)</li><li>How many possible pairs of marbles can be drawn from these two buckets? (12)</li><li>Why is the probability of getting RB 1/12, while the probability of getting GB is 1/6? (You are more likely to draw a green marble from Bucket 1 because two out of three marbles are green.)</li><li>Why is the probability of drawing at least one green the highest? (Green marbles are in each bucket. Green is more likely than red because one of the buckets has two green marbles out of 3 marbles.)</li><li>Drawing one marble from each bucket, what is the probability of drawing at least one blue or one yellow? Explain. (The total possible pairs are RR, RB, RG, RY, GR, GB, GG, GY, GR, GB, GG, GY. There are six pairs that contain either blue or yellow (RB, RY, GB, GY, GB, GY). So, the probability must be 6/12, or 1/2.)</li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>You may want to relate the area model to a tree diagram if students are having difficulty grasping the concept:</p>"
