A common student comment is that a match is more likely, since students often see two ways to get a match [two heads or two tails], but only one way to get no match [one of each]. Other students will argue that matches, like doubles when rolling two number cubes, are unlikely.) </li></ul><p>Save these conjectures where you can display them to revisit in the Summarize.</p><p></p><ul><li>If Kaleb uses this method for the month of June, how many days in June do you think Kaleb will have two hours of screen time?
