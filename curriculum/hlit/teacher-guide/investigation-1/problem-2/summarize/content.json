Discuss this as a class. It also provides an opportunity for students to make sense of a given probability.  Students have to recognize that if P(heads) = 6/11 then P(1 hour screen time) = 5/11. (Foreshadowing sum of probabilities.) Then they have to solve a proportion, or find a percent from Kaleb’s setup. Then they have to wrestle with whether the differing results are because of some error or difference in the reasoning – and finally come to the greater reliability of a larger number of trials. There should be some discussion of “the long run” here.</p><ul><li>What does the numerator in each probability tell us?
