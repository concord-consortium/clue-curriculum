            "<p><strong>Unit Description</strong></p><p>This is the only Unit in the <em>Connected Mathematics</em> curriculum that develops students’ abilities to understand and reason about probability. An understanding of probability is crucial in applying statistical ideas and being an informed citizen and consume, and engaging in STEM activities.  Questions about the likelihood of an event is to occur are asked every day. Such questions can be answered by exploring the probability of an event happening. The answers to questions about probability are informative and important to many people. This Unit explores different types of probability questions in contexts that are interesting to students, such as games, advertising, contests, and sports. Both experimental and theoretical probabilities are explored as students design and analyze experiments and recognize when experimental or theoretical data is appropriate. Through their work in this Unit, students will deepen and expand their understanding of basic probability concepts. Working with probabilities requires students to have a solid understanding of fractions and ratio. This Unit builds on the work students have done in Grades 6 and 7 with fractions and proportional relationships. The Unit makes important connections between probability and rational numbers, geometry, statistics, science, and business. Since probabilities are ratios which are scaled up and down to make predictions, students continue to strengthen their understanding of proportional relationships.  </p>"

            "<p><strong>Summary of Investigations</strong></p><p><strong>Investigation 1: A First Look at Probability </strong></p><p>Investigation 1 introduces students to experimental probabilities as a way to predict the chance that an event will occur. Students will have many opportunities to collect data from experiments using coins and paper cups. Then they will use the data collected to assign experimental probabilities to the results. Finding experimental probabilities is a concrete introduction to the ideas of possible and likely outcomes and is a practical way to get good approximations for theoretical probabilities when the complexity of the problem makes the theory difficult to apply. Many of the uses of probability in everyday situations (e.g., the cost of insurance policies) are based on experimental data. In Problem 1.1 students toss a coin to determine the experimental probability of that Kaleb will get more screen time. Then they toss a paper cup to determine the experimental probability that the cup will land on its side or one of its ends. This is the first situation in which a theoretical probability does not exist. In Problem 1.2 students toss two coins and use a match/no match to determine if Kaleb will get more screen time. In Problem 1.3 students investigate equally likely situations including those that have more than two outcomes like tossing a number cube. They also recognize that the range of probabilities for a situation is from 0 to 1. Doing the experiments helps students to make sense of the models used later to determine theoretical probabilities if they exist, students use these probabilities to make predictions. </p>"

            "<p><strong>Investigation 2: Experimental and Theoretical Probability </strong></p><p>This Investigation continues students’ work with finding experimental probabilities and formally introduces the term theoretical probability. In Problem 2.1 the colors of identically shaped objects chosen from a bag are analyzed both theoretically and experimentally. Students also consider the difference between a particular outcome being possible and being likely (or probable) and determine if a game or probabilistic situation is fair. Making an organized list and making a tree diagram are two strategies for finding all the theoretical outcomes. In Problem 2.2, students toss three coins to determine experimental probabilities for the eight outcomes. They also use lists and tree diagrams to determine the theoretical probabilities and compare these to their experimental probabilities. These strategies for finding all the outcomes in a sample space are reinforced in another experiment of drawing color blocks from two different buckets. In Problem 2.3 students continue to explore situations that involve using a spinner to determine outcomes. This introduces area as another way to determine outcomes. The crucial difference between spinners and the other objects studied so far is that a spinner has a continuous range of possibilities. The 360° angle at the end of a spinner can be subdivided into any number of angles. Students use probabilities to make predictions of an event happening many times which is another application of proportional reasoning. </p>"

They use a variety of tools in their simulations. In Problem 3.1 they design an experiment that will help them decide “fairly” which student is chosen to deliver an important message to the office.  They then go on to design a fair way to choose one of three activities they will engage in after school. Finally, they decide if students’ experiments are fair. In Problem 3.2 they analyze the Roller Derby game which involves using the sum of the numbers that result when two number cubes are tossed. Finally, in Problem 3.3 they analyze the probability that two spots on a card with five spots will have a match if the spots are chosen at random and then scratched to see the results. Throughout this Investigation students continue to use strategies from previous Investigations to determine the outcomes for theoretical probability situations. </p>"

            "<p><strong>Investigation 4: Analyzing Compound Events Using an Area Model </strong></p><p>Investigation 4 uses an area model as a way to analyze the theoretical probability of two-stage (compound) events. The probability of the second even may or may not depend on the outcome of the first event. Students design experiments with tools such as a spinner or number cubes to simulate a compound event, and experimentally determine frequencies of events such as creating purple from red and blue, or making free throws After determining experimental probabilities students use a simulation.</p><p>In Problem 4.1 the two-stage event involves using two spinners to determine how often the two spinners will yield a red and a blue to make the color purple.  They will also analyze the outcomes when a color marble is drawn from Bucket 1 and then another marble is drawn from Bucket 2.  In Problem 4.2 students investigate the outcomes for attempting a one- and-one free-throw situation. The player attempts the first free throw and then either takes a second free throw (if the first one was made) or does not get a second chance (if the first free throw was missed). After determining experimental probabilities that the player will get a score of 0, 1, or 2, students find the theoretical probability by using an area model. In Problem 4.3, students determine the long-term average (expected value) for the one- and-one free throw situation and in a variety of different probability settings. Problem 4.4 provides three binomial experiments. It is intended that each group will explore one of the experiments and then discuss the similarities and differences across the experiments and how this knowledge is useful in recognizing and solving similar contexts. The three binomial experiments are taking a four-item true-false quiz in which each answer is determined by tossing a coin. Students then find the probability of passing a true-false test if they guess at each answer.  They also analyze the outcomes of choosing left or right tiles from a bucket to make a robot move. Students use lists or tree diagrams to determine outcomes. The binomial situations lead naturally to Pascal’s Triangle, which is explored in ACE. Students use lists or tree diagrams to determine binomial probabilities in one other binomial situation which is the winning of a baseball series between two evenly matched teams.</p>"

This is not ideal. The ideas are subtle and take time to develop. The Unit starts with experiments in which each trial is an event with various possible outcomes. Students record relative frequencies of outcomes. This engages students in the idea that an experimental probability, or relative frequency, will vary as more trials occur, but will tend to one number, between 0 and 1, in the long run.  In some situations, we can calculate theoretical probability by examining and organizing all the outcomes, using lists or tree diagrams. Comparing theoretical and experimental probabilities for these events confirms that experimental probabilities, given enough repetitions, approximate theoretical probabilities. Experimental probabilities are particularly useful when the events are complex. The more complex the event the more useful simulations and experiments are. The idea of randomness is introduced, just in time to be used again in Samples and Populations.</p><p><strong>Strategic Connection</strong>: There are multiple proportional reasoning opportunities in scaling an experimental result up or restating as a percentage.</p>"
