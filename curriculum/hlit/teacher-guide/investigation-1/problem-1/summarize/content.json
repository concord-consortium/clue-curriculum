            "<p>The Initial Challenge has two goals: to see that the ratio Heads/Total tosses changes as the number of events grows and to see that the ratio of Heads/Total stabilizes as number of events/trials grows. </p><p>If you collect data from several classes and report it on a coordinate graph showing the ratio Heads/Total tosses changing as the number of total tosses changes, you will see that the ratio Heads/Tails gets closer to 0.5. If you keep the raw data (Heads, Total tosses) as well as (Heads/Tails, Total tosses) you will also see that the difference between number of heads and ½ number of tosses grows. For example, after four tosses we might have (3 heads, 4 tosses) or (3/4, 4). We expect two heads. The ratio is far from the expected ½, but the raw number is only one more.  After 100 tosses we might have (55 heads, 100 tosses) or (0.55, 100). The ratio is close to the expected 0.5 but the raw number is now 5 bigger than the expected 50. (Portrayal)</p><ul><li>Is the ratio getting closer to 1:2? (Yes)</li><li>Is the number of heads getting closer to ½ number of tosses? (Yes)</li></ul><p>(In one case we are thinking multiplicatively about a comparison, in the other additively.)</p><p>Results for individual groups with the cup toss are unlikely to be identical. As in the coin toss, you can add the data for each group one at a time, computing the fractions and percents with each additional group. Use <strong>Teaching Aid 1.1B: Class Data Summary</strong> to record the data. This can help students see where the relative frequency of landing on an end begins to level off. </p><ul><li>How did the results of the cup toss compare to our predictions?  (Answers will vary depending on the predictions.)</li><li>Did you all arrive at the same conclusion about which outcome (the paper cup landing on its side or the cup landing on an end) is more likely?</li><li>Does this fraction represent a ratio? (In this Problem there are two ratios: the number of times the cup lands on its side (or end) to the total number of tosses, and the number of times the cup lands on its side to the number of times it lands on its end.)</li><li>Is my (side landings)/50 = or ≠ (class combined side landings)/50?  (Answers will vary)</li><li>The 30 trials scale by how many groups of data we are collecting as a class?  Do the number of side landings scale that way too?  Does it create a proportion? (It is not a perfect set of data.  Too many variables in the situation to control. Refer to question 4 in the What If to compare and contrast this idea.)</li><li>Do you agree with Ashley or Eli in What If Situation A? (Ashley is correct. The cup toss does not have a 50/50 chance of occurring.)</li></ul>"
