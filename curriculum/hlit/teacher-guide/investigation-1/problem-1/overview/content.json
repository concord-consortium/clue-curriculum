          "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>In Problem 1.1, students collect the results of coin tosses and use the data to determine the chances of tossing heads. They may intuitively know that the probability is 50%, or   Through experimentation, they will discover that although there is a great deal of variation for a small number of trials, the percent of heads approaches 50% as large numbers of trials are conducted. This is sometimes referred to as the Law of Large Numbers.</p><p>In the What If, students experiment with paper cups. Unlike the coin situation, students do not know what results to expect when they toss paper cups. This is the studentsâ€™ first exposure to a situation in which experimentation is necessary for getting a sense of the behavior.</p><p></p><p>A theoretical analysis of the behavior of a paper cup being tossed is not available. Students will conduct an experiment in which they toss a paper cup and determine the following fractions.</p>"
