            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>In Problem 1.1, students collect the results of coin tosses and use the data to determine the chances of tossing heads. They may intuitively know that the probability is 50%, or 1/2. Through experimentation, they will discover that although there is a great deal of variation for a small number of trials, the percent of heads approaches 50% as large numbers of trials are conducted. This is sometimes referred to as the Law of Large Numbers.</p><p>In the What If, students experiment with paper cups. Unlike the coin situation, students do not know what results to expect when they toss paper cups. This is the students’ first exposure to a situation in which experimentation is necessary for getting a sense of the behavior.</p><p>A theoretical analysis of the behavior of a paper cup being tossed is not available. Students will conduct an experiment in which they toss a paper cup and determine the following fractions.</p>"
