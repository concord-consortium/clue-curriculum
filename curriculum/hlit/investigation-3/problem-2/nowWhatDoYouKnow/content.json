He also studied problems in probability like the ones you have seen.</p><p>A famous problem he worked on involved rolling three number cubes. He looked at the possibilities for getting a sum of 9 or a sum of 10. </p><p>A sum of 9 is made using six groups of numbers:</p><p>(1,2,6), (1,3,5), (1,4,4), (2,2,5), (2,3,4), and (3,3,3).</p><p>A sum of 10 is made using six groups other of numbers:</p><p>(1,3,6), (1,4,5), (2,2,6), (2,3,5), (2,4,4), and (3,3,4).</p><p>What puzzled people is that, when they did experiments, the sum of 10 occurred more often. By making a diagram similar to a counting tree, Galileo showed the theoretical probability matched the experimental results.
