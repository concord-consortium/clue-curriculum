            "<p><strong>Scratching Spots Game: Designing and Using a Simulation</strong></p><p>People in different kinds of jobs find simulations useful to their business. A <strong>simulation</strong> is a model used to find experimental probabilities when it is not possible to work with a real situation. For example, when the first astronauts flew in space, they practiced in simulators to give them a sense of what it would be like in space. </p><p>In this Problem, we will design a simulation that will help us predict the outcomes of picking two spots on a card that match. The spots hide the names of some electronic games. If the two spots match, the player wins the electronic game. </p>"
