            "<p><strong>a.  </strong>Since the probability of choosing a white marble is 3/10, there must be at least 10 marbles in the bag.</p><p><strong>b.  </strong>Yes. Possible answer: Let’s assume the bag contains 60 marbles. Since the probability of choosing red is 1/5, then 1/5 of the proposed 60 marbles, or 12 marbles, would be red. Since 3/10 of the 60 marbles must be white, 18 would be white. This gives us a total of 30 marbles, so the other 30 marbles would be blue. Since we get whole numbers of marbles when we do this division, the bag could contain 60 marbles.</p><p><strong>c.  </strong>Possible answer: Since 3/10 of the marbles in the bag are white, and 6 marbles are white, we need to answer this question: 3/10 of what number equals 6? The answer is 20. This works because P(red) = 1/5, and 1/5 of 20 = 4 red marbles. Since 4 marbles are red and 6 are white, there are 20 – 10 = 10 blue marbles in the bag.</p><p><strong>d.  </strong>Possible answer: You could add the other two probabilities (of red and white) and subtract the result from 1: 1/5 + 3/10 = 2/10 + 3/10 = 5/10, and 1 - (5/10) = 5/10, or 1/2. So, the probability of choosing a blue marble is 1/2.</p>"
