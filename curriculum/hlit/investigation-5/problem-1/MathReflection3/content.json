            "<p><strong>Reflections on the Mathematical Practices</strong></p><p>As you worked on the Problems in this Investigation, you used prior mathematical knowledge to make sense of them. You also applied mathematical reasoning to solve the Problems. For example,</p><p>Ken said his group was making decisions about fairness in Problem 3.1. We had several tools: coins, colored cubes, spinners, number cubes, playing cards, or straws. </p><p></p><p>We had to determine which one was the most reasonable for choosing a messenger. </p><p>We also explained how we decided each tool was fair or not. To determine the fairness of each tool, we had to understand how each tool was used. We wanted to make sure each of the three students had the same chance of being chosen. Our group used a number cube. Billie goes if 1 or 2 comes up. Evo goes if 3 or 4 comes up. Carla goes if 5 or 6 comes up. As a class, we found a way to make each tool work. </p><p></p><ul><li>What mathematical practice(s) did Kenâ€™s group use to solve this problem?</li><li>What other mathematical practices did you use to solve problems in this Investigation?</li><li>In what ways is the mathematics in this Problem connected to prior mathematics?</li></ul>"
