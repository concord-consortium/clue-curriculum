We can express these ratios in fraction form or as percents. The mathematical word for chance is <strong>probability</strong>. A probability that we find by conducting an experiment and collecting data is called an <strong>experimental probability</strong>. </p><p>Suppose we toss a paper cup 50 times and it lands on its side 31 times. Each toss of the cup is a <strong>trial</strong>. In this experiment, there are 50 trials. <strong>Favorable outcomes</strong> are the trials in which a desired result occurs. In this case, a favorable result, landed on its side, occurred 31 times.</p><p>To find the experimental probability, we use the part-to-whole ratio.</p>"
