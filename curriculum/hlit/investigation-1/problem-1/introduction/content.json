To make some decisions, we consider the chance, or likelihood, that something will happen. We may listen to the weather forecast to decide whether you will wear a raincoat to school. In some cases, we may even let chance decide for us, such as when we roll a number cube to see who goes first in a game. A number cube shows the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 on its faces. </p>"
