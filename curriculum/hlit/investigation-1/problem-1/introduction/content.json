            "<p>Decisions, decisions, decisions—we make decisions every day. We choose what to wear, with whom to have lunch, what to do after school, and maybe what time to go to bed. To make some decisions, we consider the chance, or likelihood, that something will happen. An event is an occurrence or experiment we use to make predictions. For example, tossing a coin is an event. It has two possible outcomes: either heads turns up or tails turns up. Outcomes are the possible results of an event.</p><p>We may listen to the weather forecast to decide whether we will wear a raincoat to school. In some cases, we may even let chance decide for us, such as when we roll a number cube<strong> </strong>to see who goes first in a game. A number cube shows the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 on its faces. </p>"
