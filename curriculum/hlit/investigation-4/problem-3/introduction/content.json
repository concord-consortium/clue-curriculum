          "<p><strong>Finding Long-term Averages</strong>
</p><p>In the last Problem, we looked at probabilities for several different situations that involve compound events such as the one-and-one free throw situation. You might have been surprised about which outcome is most likely. In this Problem, we will look at the number of points Nishi can expect to make each time she is in a one-and-one free throw situation. 
</p><p>So, if a player makes many free throws over a season, then the mean or average number of points for each one-and-one free throw situation is called the <strong>long-term average. </strong>
</p><p><em>What do you think her long- term average will be for a one-and-one free throw situation?</em>
</p><p>In Problem 4.2 we used an area model to determine the probability that Nishi would get a score of 0, 1, or 2 in one-and-one free throw situation. Nishi is a 60% free throw shooter.
