            "<p><em>Did You Know?</em></p><p>The use of binomial events like, “heads or tails,” “yes or no,” or “0 or 1” have an interesting history. For example, during the 1940–1950s when computer programming was in its early development, Short Code and FORTAN became popular. These programs were the first to use 0 or 1 to replace statements. In 1951, Grace Hopper used “0 and 1” to replace statements which eventually led to faster programming with the development of COBOL. It more closely resembles English-like grammar and is widely used in business situations.</p>"
