We always want to know our chances of winning in each situation. It helps if we have some strategies to analyze a situation. </p><p></p><p>Many of the previous situations were compound events, that is, events that occur in two stages. For example, we drew a colored cube from Bag 1 and then drew another colored cube from Bag 2. In Tawandaâ€™s Toys, we scratched one spot out of five choices and then we scratched another spot from four choices. </p><p></p><p><em>What are some other compound events we have studied in this Unit?</em></p><p></p><p>We have used tables, lists, and diagrams to describe and analyze outcomes or the sample space for compound events. An area model is another useful tool for determining and analyzing the sample space for compound events. The goal is to divide the area into parts that correctly reflect the chances to win for each action. </p>"
