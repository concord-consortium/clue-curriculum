            "<p><strong>Dilations and Similar Figures</strong></p><p>The Problems in the first three Investigations focus on comparing figures to see if they have identical shape and size under reflections, translations, or rotations. We answered the question:</p><p>                              What transformations preserve congruent shapes?</p><p></p><p>We know, from earlier work in <em>curriculum/fsss/images/screenshot-2024-04-21-at-4.53.44 pm.png</em>, that interesting things happen when we enlarge or reduce a figure. We created and analyzed many scale drawings or similar shapes in <em>Stretching and Shrinking</em>.</p><p></p><p>For example, we used a rubber band tool to enlarge a picture on a flyer.</p>"
