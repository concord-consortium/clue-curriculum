            "<p><strong>Investigation 1</strong></p><p><strong>Transformations</strong></p><p>In the Shapes and Designs unit, we looked at the properties that determine shapes. Designing Under Conditions problems showed us that a set of minimal conditions would produce unique triangles and quadrilaterals. That is, it would produce the same shape and size of the shape. These figures were called <strong>congruent figures</strong>. </p><p></p><p>In the Stretching and Shrinking unit we created shapes that had the same shape, but not necessarily the same size. These figures were called scale drawings or<strong> similar figures.</strong> Transformations can help us think about similarity and congruence in a different way.</p><p></p><p>In the Stretching and Shrinking unit Marta and Zack were designing a video game with the character Mug Wump. They used a coordinate grid to move him to different positions. For example, the following diagram shows several images of Mug Wump with a new hat and carrying a flag. </p><p></p>"
