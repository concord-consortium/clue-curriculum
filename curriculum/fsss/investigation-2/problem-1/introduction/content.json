            "<p>We have learned that reflections, translations, and rotations preserve the size and shape of a figure. That is, the original figure and its image are <em>congruent</em>. This suggests a way to show that two figures are congruent. One figure is congruent to another if the second figure can be obtained from the first by a sequence of reflections, translations, or rotations.</p><p></p><p>In this investigation, we will focus on congruent triangles. Triangles are a very special family of geometric figures. They are used in many construction projects to provide strength and stability for structures. For example, the George Washington Bridge connecting New Jersey and New York City uses many congruent triangles to strengthen the bridges towers.</p>"
