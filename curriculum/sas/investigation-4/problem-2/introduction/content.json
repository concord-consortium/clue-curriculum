The ratios are equal.</p><p>In Problem 3.3, we found the distance across a river using similar triangles. We can find the height of a school building by climbing a ladder and using a long tape measure. We can also use easier and less dangerous ways to find the height.  In the next problem we will find the height of an object using similar triangles.</p>"
