So, we cannot consider the smaller triangle as a unit rep-tile. The distance from Stake 1 to Stake 2 in smaller triangle is 80 ft. The corresponding distance in larger triangle is 140 ft (from Tree 1 to Tree 2). If you put two small triangles, it will be 160 ft long, which is longer than 140 ft. You cannot fit whole amounts of the small triangles in the large triangle. Therefore, you cannot use rep-tiles to show the similarity.</p>"
