The lengths in the image seem to be twice as long as the corresponding lengths in the original.</li><li>The perimeters of the body and the hat in the image seem to be twice as long as those in the original. Students may reason that since each line segment doubles, the perimeter, which is the sum of these doubled line segments, will also double. (Doubling each side individually then finding the perimeter is the same as finding the perimeter and then doubling it. This is intuitively the Distributive Property: 2L + 2L + 2w + 2w = 2(L + L + w + w).)</li></ul><ol><li>The areas of the body and hat in the image seem to be 4 times as large as those in the original. Students may see that approximately 4 of the original rectangles (hats) can fit into the enlarged rectangle (hat). If students say the areas are 3 or 4 times as large, this is fine at this stage. The important idea is that the area is more than twice as large.</li><li>The distances of each figure from the anchor point P also have a 2 to 1 ratio. That is, each point on the image is twice the distance from P as the original corresponding point is from P.</li></ol><ul><li>Note that the answers above are true in the ideal case. In practice, the 2 to 1 ratio of the lengths (and the 4 to 1 ratio of the areas) will not always be observed. This is because of the imperfection of the bands and some differences in the application of the method. More precise methods will be explored in the next problems. </li><li>The rubber band stretcher results are more accurate if the end of the rubber band on point P is fixed by holding a pin instead of holding by hand directly, if the image end of the band is held as close to the page as possible using the pencil, if the pencil chosen is as thin as possible since its thickness might cause the band in the image end to be shorter than it is supposed to be, or if the bands are not stretched too much.</li></ul>"
