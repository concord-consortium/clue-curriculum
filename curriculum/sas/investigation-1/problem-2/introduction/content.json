            "<p><strong>Problem 1.2</strong></p><p>In Problem 1.1 A, Daphne used ratio relationships to solve the mystery. She reasoned:</p><p><em>For every inch measured on the PI magazine, there are 10 inches of the PI magazine in real life. I used the PI magazine height to measure the height of the teacher. The teacher is 7 PI magazines tall. So, in real life the teacher is 7 x 10 inches or 70 inches tall.</em></p><p>Daphne’s reasoning is similar to the reasoning you have done in the <em>Comparing Quantities</em> unit where you used ratios to describe and compare quantities. Recall that a <em>ratio </em>is a comparison of two quantities which have a multiplicative relationship, such as two lengths.</p><ul><li> 1 PI magazine height<strong> to</strong> the height of the teacher (7 PI magazines), or</li><li> 1 PI magazine<strong> : </strong>7 PI magazines, or </li><li> 10 in <strong>: </strong>70 in</li><li> Using ratio relationships to solve problems is also called <em>proportional reasoning</em>.</li></ul>"
