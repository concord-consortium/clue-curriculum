            "<p><strong>Problem 1.2</strong></p><p><strong>Rubber Band Stretcher Experiment: Drawing Similar (Scale) Figures</strong></p><p>In Problem 1.1, Daphne used <em>ratio relationships</em> to solve the mystery. She reasoned:</p><p><em>For every inch measured on the PI Monthly magazine, there are 10 inches of the PI Monthly magazine in real life. </em></p><p><em>I used the PI Monthly magazine height to measure the height of the teacher. </em></p><p><em>The teacher is 7 PI Monthly magazines tall. So, in real life the teacher is 7 x 10 inches or 70 inches tall.</em></p><p>Daphneâ€™s reasoning is similar to the reasoning we have done in the <em>Comparing Quantities</em> unit where we used ratios to describe and compare quantities. Recall that a <em>ratio </em>is a comparison of two quantities which have a multiplicative relationship, such as two lengths.</p><ul><li> 1 <em>P.I. Monthly</em> magazine height for every picture height of the teacher (7 <em>P.I. Monthly</em> magazines) or</li><li> 1 <em>P.I. Monthly</em> magazine height to the picture height of the teacher (7 <em>P.I. Monthly</em> magazines) or </li><li> 1 <em>P.I. Monthly</em> magazine : 7 <em>P.I. Monthly</em> magazines</li><li> 10 inches : 70 inches</li></ul><p>Using ratio relationships to solve problems is also called proportional reasoning. The picture of the real-life teacher is an <strong>image</strong> of the teacher. The original figure and its image are similar figures or <strong>scale drawings</strong>. In this problem, we will compare features of the original figure and its image.</p><p><em>What stays the same? What changes?</em></p>"
