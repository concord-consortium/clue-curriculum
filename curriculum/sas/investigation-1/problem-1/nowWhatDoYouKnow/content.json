When a person standing near the wall is filmed, this makes it easier to estimate the personâ€™s height. Investigators take measurements of tire marks at the scene of auto accidents to help them estimate the speed of the vehicles involved. Photographs and molds of footprints help the detectives determine the shoe size, type of shoe, and weight of the person who made the prints.</p>"
