            "<p>At this stage, students tend to first find the scale factor between a pair of similar figures, then multiply the scale factor by a given side length to obtain the measure of the missing, corresponding side length.</p>",
            "<p>Students find missing angle measures by recalling that similar figures have corresponding angles with the same measure. They need to recall that the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle is 180Â°, which they learned in Shapes and Designs. In the next Investigation, students will find missing side lengths by using ratios.</p>"
