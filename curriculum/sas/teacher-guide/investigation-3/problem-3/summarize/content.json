The rep-tile would have to have measures that keep the 80:120 ratio, and end up fitting into 140 feet, so Durrell could use a triangle with sides 2’ : 3’ (or 1 : 1.5) and rep-tile that up to 140 : 210)</li><li>In What If...?

(Answers will vary.)</li><li>Does finding the mean distance in What If . . . ? Situation C make sense? (Yes. It finds the value if all data pieces could be equal. This can help to “even out” any errors made in some of the measurements.)</li></ul><p>Note: The width of a river can vary at different points.
