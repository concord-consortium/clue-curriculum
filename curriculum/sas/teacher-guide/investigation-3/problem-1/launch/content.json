            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p><p>This Problem challenges students to find ways of putting multiple copies of a figure together to make a larger, similar figure. This process is called rep‑tiling. Rep‑tiling allows students to revisit similarity in a new context. In deciding how to put rep‑tiles together, students identify relationships between the scale factor, side lengths, and areas of similar figures. For example, they find that if the scale factor from a smaller quadrilateral to a larger quadrilateral is 2, the side lengths and perimeter grow by a factor of 2. The area, however, grows by a factor of 2<sup>2</sup>, or 4.</p>"

This Problem continues students’ exploration of scale factors and similarity by rep-tiling, or building shapes from copies of smaller, similar shapes with a focus on the area change.</p><p>In each of these contexts, students study how the areas of two similar figures are related to the scale factor. It is often surprising to students that if they apply a scale factor of 2 to a figure (or in general, n), the area becomes four times as great (in general, n2 as great).</p><p>At this stage, students should not be concerned with area calculations. Instead, students use rep-tiles to see that when they apply a scale factor of 2, it requires four copies of the original figure. In this case, students measure area using the original figure as the unit rather than units of square inches or square centimeters.</p>"
