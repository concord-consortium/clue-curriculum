            "<p><strong>Unit Description</strong></p><p>Knowledge of similarity is important to the development of students’ understanding of the geometry in their environment. In their immediate environment and in their studies of natural and social sciences, students frequently encounter phenomena that require familiarity with the ideas of enlargement, scale factors, area growth, indirect measurement, and other similarity-related concepts. Similar figures are another name for scale drawings. In scale drawings, the original figure and its image are similar figures. In this unit we will use the two terms interchangeably. </p><p>Similarity is also a context in which students’ understanding of proportional reasoning continues to deepen. For example, if you increase the size of a diagram by 50%, then distances in the enlarged diagram are proportional to distances in the original diagram. Specifically, every distance in the enlargement is a constant multiple (1.5) of the corresponding distance in the original. It is generally recognized that understanding proportional reasoning is an important stage in cognitive development.  </p><p>Students in the middle grades often experience difficulty with ideas of scale, which is the heart of proportionality. They confuse adding situations with multiplying situations. Situations requiring comparison by addition or subtraction come first in students’ experience with mathematics and often dominate their thinking about any comparison situation, even those in which scale is the fundamental issue. For example, when considering the dimensions of a rectangle that began as 3 units by 5 units and was enlarged to a similar rectangle with a short side of 6 units, many students will say the long side is now 8 units rather than 10 units. They add 3 units to the 5 units rather than multiply the 5 units by 2, the scale factor. These students may struggle to build a useful conception that will help them distinguish between situations that are additive and those that are multiplicative (calling for scaling up or down).  </p><p>The Problems in this Unit are designed to help students begin to accumulate the knowledge and experiences necessary to make these kinds of distinctions and to reason about scaling in geometry situations. The next Unit, Comparing and Scaling, will continue to deepen their reasoning with proportions in the context of quantities. It develops these ideas in numerical, rather than geometric, contexts. Students develop understanding of what it means to be similar figures (scale drawings), this knowledge is required for students to be successful in the 8th grade unit, <em>Flip, Spin, Slide, and Stretch.</em></p>"

For example, in the diagram below, focusing on length and location of line segment ED under the impact of two different rules, we see image 1 of line segment ED is the same size as the original but displaced or translated 2 units right and 3 up. But, image 2 of line segment ED is half the size and half the distance from the origin. If we apply these rules to all the points the first rule will give a congruent figure; the second will give a similar figure with lengths all ½ the original and corresponding angles the same size. This echoes the rubber band experiment. The origin is the fixed point. (Distance to origin is also halved.)</p><p>LINK TO THE FUTURE: In 8th grade students study transformations. Transforming x, y by multiplying by a&gt;1, (x, y) -&gt; (ax, ay),  creates a  similar figure, an enlargement or dilation,  with scale factor  a.  Transforming by multiplying by a &lt; 1 creates a similar figure smaller than the original. Transforming by adding only, creates a congruent figure at a different location, a translation. Transforming by multiplying by a negative scale factor creates a double reflection.</p>"
