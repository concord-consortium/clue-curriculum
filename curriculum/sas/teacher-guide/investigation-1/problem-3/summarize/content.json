Students will often use additive descriptions first such as, ”For 150% you just take the original and added on half as much.”  Guide them to refine their thinking and use multiplicative structures to see that the side lengths are 1.5 times longer.)</li><li>To help students think about these ideas with a multiplicative structure versus additive you could ask them if there is a way to use a “for every” statement to express their idea.  (“For every length on the original the corresponding length on the image is 1.5 times as long”.)</li><li>If I want to enlarge a figure by 25% will the image be larger or smaller than the original? What number do I enter in the photocopier? (To increase a figure by 25% you multiply the figure by a factor of 1.25. So, you enter 125% into the photocopier.)  Explain why this is true.</li><li>If we want to make a copy of the original drawing that does NOT change the size, what percent would we use?(100%)</li><li>How do the corresponding angles of the Super Sleuth’s characters compare?  (Corresponding angles are all the same angle measure) </li></ul>"

This is the same as multiplying the original number by 125% because x + 0.25x = 1x + 0.25x = (1 + 0.25)x = 1.25x.</p><p>Draw a square on a transparent grid on the overhead to show what happens with an increase of 25% To make the enlargement, first enlarge two adjacent sides of the original square, and then complete the square. Compare the two squares. (If the original side length is 1, then the new side length is 1.25. So, the lengths grew by a factor of 1.25. That is, each side length was multiplied by 1.25.)</p>"
