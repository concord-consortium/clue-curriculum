            "<p><strong>Suggested Questions: </strong></p><ul><li>What is a typical unit of measure to describe the height of the building (or other object you choose) based on the class data? Why? (Possible answer. Meters: They are big enough that we won’t have huge numbers recorded, but small enough that we will have an answer larger than 1.) </li><li>Why does each angle of the large triangle have the same measure as the corresponding angle of the small triangle? (The statue is at a right angle to the ground, so we are careful to hold the stick at a right angle to the ground, too. Another angle is the angle formed by the sun and the ground. For two nearby points at a common time, the sun appears at the same angle, making these corresponding angles congruent. Finally, the third angle must be the same in each triangle since all three interior angles of a triangle must add to 180°.) </li><li>What does this suggest about the similarity of the triangles? (Because all of the angles of the two triangles are congruent, the triangles are similar.)</li><li>When using the shadow method, what problems might affect the accuracy of your answer? (Answers will vary.)</li><li>How did you use scale factor/ratio to find the height of the principal? (Answers will vary) </li><li>How did you use scale factor/ratio to find the height of the Statue of Liberty? (Answers will vary) </li></ul>"
