(Answers will vary.)</li></ul><p>When students are working with the mirror method in What If...? Situation A monitor how they are making their measurements.

Situation A. monitor how they are making their measurements. Assist them with measuring from end to end on the&nbsp;shadow. </p><p><em>Planning for the Summary</em></p><p>What evidence will you use in the Summary to clarify and deepen understanding of the Now What Do You Know?
