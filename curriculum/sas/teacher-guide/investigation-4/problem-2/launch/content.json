            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p>",
            "<p>In this Problem, students use shadows and mirror reflections to estimate the heights of real objects that are difficult to measure directly. Students recognize that the mathematics they have learned so far in this Unit is helpful for solving problems in real life.</p>",
            "<p>If it is not sunny or you do not have the resources to complete this Problem outside, you can use an alternative method of measuring inaccessible heights or lengths using a picture.</p>",
            "<p>Students recognize that the mathematics they have learned so far in this Unit is helpful for solving problems in real life.</p>",
            "<p>The parallel lines of the rays can be used to show that the corresponding angles are equal. This was done in Shapes and Designs. In the Shapes and Designs Unit students find that they can only draw one (unique) triangle given three angle measures. This means that if two triangles have corresponding angles equal, then the figures are congruent and hence similar. Sun and shadows always produce similar triangles.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Mathematics Note:</strong>  We have only used adjacent sides because we are dealing with are triangles and rectangles. The sides being compared do not have to be adjacent if we are working with other figures. For example, in a hexagon the ratio of any two sides will work as long as the ratio of the same corresponding side lengths in the other hexagon work.</p>",
            "Implementation Note:  What If Situation A has two experiments. One is using the shadow method to find the height of a tall object near the school.  The second experiment is using the mirror method to find the heigh of a tall object in your school.  You could do one or both of these with your students."

(Two triangles.)</li><li>How do you know they are similar? (Answers will vary.  The corresponding angles are congruent)</li><li>If it is a sunny day, we can use the sun to help us estimate heights that we are interested in measuring. When the sun shines on objects, the objects cast shadows. From your experiences, what can you say about the shadows that the sun casts? (Students may note that the length of the shadow depends on the height of the object. They may also note that shadows for all objects change length as the sun moves during the day. Shadows are longer when the sun is near the horizon, whether in the morning or evening, and very short in the middle of the day when the sun is more directly overhead. They may mention that shadows are cast in the same direction for all objects.) </li><li>Let’s think about the relationship between the length of a shadow and the height of an object. At the same time of day, how will the shadows of two objects that have different heights compare? (The shadow of the taller object will be longer.) </li><li>This means that the length of the shadow depends on the height of the object. Imagine that you are looking at a tall pole when the sun casts a shadow for the pole. In your mind, move around the pole until you can see both the pole and its shadow from the side. Sketch what you think this would look like. (Make sure the students envision the two legs of the right triangle made by the pole and the shadow.) (Portrayal)</li><li>Who would like to share their sketch with the class? (A sample sketch is shown below)</li></ul>"
