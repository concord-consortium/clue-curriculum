            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p>",
            "<p>In Problem 4.1, students find a ratio for adjacent side lengths within a figure. They compare this ratio to the ratio for adjacent sides in corresponding positions within another figure. They recognize that, for similar figures, these ratios are equivalent. Students also find the scale factor between similar figures. They then compare the information that is given by the scale factor to the information that is given by the ratios of adjacent side lengths. Students notice that they can use angle measures and side-length ratios to test for similarity in triangles. </p>",
            "<p><strong>Note:</strong> In Grade 6, ratios were expressed as comparison statements such as “For every $3 Mary raises, Liz raises $5.” The ratio of the amount of money Mary raises to the amount Liz raises is 3 : 5. In this Investigation, ratios are also written as fractions such as 3/5  or 5/3.  This Unit, and in particular this Investigation, leads naturally to the next Unit, Comparing and Scaling. In Comparing and Scaling, students will continue to explore ratio and proportion, and develop strategies to solve problems that involve proportions.</p>"

            "<p><strong>Mathematics Note:</strong> The connection between fractions and ratios is complex. </p>",
            "<p>You can write a ratio in fraction notation. For example, you might have 1 green marble for every 2 white marbles. This can be written 1:2, which can be written ½ . ½ as a fraction means 1 part out of two totals in the whole, whereas this ½ as a ratio does not imply anything about total. It is a part-to-part ratio. </p>",
            "<p>Another difference between fractions and ratios is putting together amounts. When adding fractions, we get equal size pieces in the whole (denominator) and add the number of pieces (numerators). For example, 1/2 + 1/2 = 2/2. If we combine two ratios, we can add to both the quantities. For example, if we have a box of 1 green for every 2 white and another box of 1 green for every 2 white, we get 2 green for every 4 white. Or, 1/2 and 1/2 as a ratio could mean 2/4. Many times, we combine ratios to find equivalent ratios.</p>",
            "<p>Students often do not understand all of the subtleties between fractions and ratios. For this reason, when you write ratios in fraction form, it is helpful for students to label the two quantities from the ratio. For example,</p>",
