(Two parallelograms can have corresponding adjacent sides that are in the same ratio but have angle measures that are different. We found out in <em>Shapes and Designs</em> that we might have two sides with lengths of 5 and two sides with lengths of 10, for example, that form a parallelogram. This parallelogram can have angles of any size. For similarity, corresponding angles must be congruent. Rectangles always have congruent angle measures, however. A rectangle always has four 90° angles.)</li><li>Describe the criteria that are necessary for two parallelograms to be similar. (Parallelograms must have congruent corresponding angle measures. Also, the corresponding ratios of adjacent sides must be equal. Note that instead of mentioning ratios, students might suggest that scale factors between shapes must be the consistent for all sets of corresponding sides. Both criteria for side lengths are correct.)</li></ul>"
