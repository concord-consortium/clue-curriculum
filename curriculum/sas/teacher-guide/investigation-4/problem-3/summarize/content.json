Since all the angles are 90° they are all similar.</li><li><u>Teacher</u>: Does everyone agree with Jackson’s group?</li><li><u>Noemi</u>: No. That is only true for squares because since you start with all sides being the same when it is scaled up all sides will scale up the same but with non-square rectangles that isn’t the case.</li><li><u>Jackson</u>: So, which one is the imposter.</li><li><u>Noemi</u>: We think the small rectangle is the imposter.</li><li><u>Jackson</u>: But it looks like the other two. It is a rectangle.</li><li><u>Noemi</u>: We said that at first too.  But then we looked for a scale factor and found that there is 1.5 from the medium to large rectangle and when we tried to find a scale factor from the small to either the medium or large it didn’t work.</li><li><u>Teacher</u>: What did other groups find?</li><li><u>Bobbe</u>: We did what Noemi’s group did. From the small to medium–the short sides grew 2 times as much and the long sides 3 times as much so there isn’t a scale factor. From small to larger the short sides grew 3 times as much and the long sides 4.5 times as much, so they don’t have a scale factor either. (Bobbe shows this in a drawing.)</li></ul>"
